        startup


        drakx

what security level?
       

        kde

at startup:
   Can't get own host name. Your system is serveral misconfigured
although "hostname" binary answers localhost.localdomain (set by
sethostname from init of stage1)

font of konsole still too large and non proportional (same
problem as 9.2 it seems)


        system running

Click on the Menu/Doc/Howtos > Fail

in free mode, one can't put a file as /usr/share/speedtouch/mgmt.o
       put a symlink to a place in /etc?
       change the location in /etc/speedtouch.conf? (but no good
       since drakconnect's messages are hardcoded with that)


        usb key

/etc/X11/X
        is a link but vfat doesn't handle links :(
