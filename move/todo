at startup:
   Can't get own host name. Your system is serveral misconfigured
although "hostname" binary answers localhost.localdomain (set by
sethostname from init of stage1)

font of konsole still too large and non proportional (same
problem as 9.2 it seems)

$BROWSER must be set


        system running

kill root console on #2 when kde is ready? e.g. password locked screensaver

Click on the Menu/Doc/Howtos > Fail
