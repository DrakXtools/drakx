error at X startup -> better msg

what security level?

auto-configure of most remaining things
       tv
       
graphical design

usb key


        kde

at startup:
   Can't get own host name. Your system is serveral misconfigured
although "hostname" binary answers localhost.localdomain (set by
sethostname from init of stage1)

font of konsole still too large and non proportional (same
problem as 9.2 it seems)


        system running

services:
        what to do? /sbin/runlevel returns "unknown" and
        printerdrake wants to propose to enable cups at boot -
        more generally: do we want to keep settings of services
        permanent, if yes we need to hack utmp/sysv/init stuff

need to list things to remove in MCC (drakgw, etc -> things that
have not the necessary packages and we don't want to provide)
