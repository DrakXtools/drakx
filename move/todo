        startup


        drakx

what security level?
       

        kde

at startup:
   Can't get own host name. Your system is serveral misconfigured
although "hostname" binary answers localhost.localdomain (set by
sethostname from init of stage1)

font of konsole still too large and non proportional (same
problem as 9.2 it seems)

$BROWSER must be set


        system running

some system configuration need a logout (XF: mouse settings,
resolution, but also language), currently logout will reboot
machine, need something better (gc: relaunch X+kde)

kill root console on #2 when kde is ready? e.g. password locked screensaver

halt/reboot/ctrl+alt+del have bad behaviour

Click on the Menu/Doc/Howtos > Fail

we can't setup kde language in /usr/share/kdeglobals, need to do
it in homedir directly from lang::write


        usb key

/etc/X11/X
        is a link but vfat doesn't handle links :(
