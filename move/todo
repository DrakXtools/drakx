        startup

shut up parport_pc failure messages
     have to deal with modprobe/insmod/kmod/syslog :/
     (doesn't happen on most machines, it seems!?)


        drakx

what security level?
       
test usb mouse (qa report a failure)

ps2 wheel mouse, no support for wheel :(

need to mount other cdroms


        kde

at startup:
   Can't get own host name. Your system is serveral misconfigured
although "hostname" binary answers localhost.localdomain (set by
sethostname from init of stage1)

font of konsole still too large and non proportional (same
problem as 9.2 it seems)

$BROWSER must be set

        system running

services:
        what to do? /sbin/runlevel returns "unknown" and
        printerdrake wants to propose to enable cups at boot -
        more generally: do we want to keep settings of services
        permanent, if yes we need to hack utmp/sysv/init stuff

        - chkconfig --del everything
        - use level 5 and use it by hand at startup

need to list things to remove in MCC (drakgw, etc -> things that
have not the necessary packages and we don't want to provide)

some system configuration need a logout (XF: mouse settings,
resolution, but also language), currently logout will reboot
machine, need something better (gc: relaunch X+kde)

kill root console on #2 when kde is ready? e.g. password locked screensaver

halt/reboot/ctrl+alt+del have bad behaviour

        usb key

/etc/X11/X
        is a link but vfat doesn't handle links :(
