        build

ensure that kernel used in isolinux/stage1 is the same as kernel
installed in the tree so that we have /lib/modules available

        
        drakx

what security level?

auto-configure of most remaining things
       network
       tv
       printer
       
graphical design

usb key


        kde

at startup:
   Can't get own host name. Your system is serveral misconfigured
although "hostname" binary answers localhost.localdomain (set by
sethostname from init of stage1)

kbuildsycoca -> optimize out?

font of konsole still too large and non proportional (same
problem as 9.2 it seems)



        system running

services:
        what to do? /sbin/runlevel returns "unknown" and
        printerdrake wants to propose to enable cups at boot -
        more generally: do we want to keep settings of services
        permanent, if yes we need to hack utmp/sysv/init stuff

need to list things to remove in MCC (drakgw, etc -> things that
have not the necessary packages and we don't want to provide)
