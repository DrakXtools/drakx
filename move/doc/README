                     MandrakeMove README


      General overview.

Mandrake Move is a "live" Mandrake Linux Discovery based system,
an OS which boots off a removable device (a CDROM in our case)
without needing any installation on hard drive (it doesn't need
any harddrive in computer actually).

Mandrake Move brings two main innovations:

- ability to eject the CDROM which Move was booted from, still
  running a multimedia player, so that user can play
  ogg/mp3/vcd/avi/dvd discs without needing a second CDROM drive

- transparently saving user and system data to a USB key


      Technical aspects.

  CDROM ejecting.

Works by killing most unneeded running application (open-office,
frozen-bubble, gimp, etc), then transfering X/kde/totem files
(already pertaining to a loopback) into memory, then CDROM drive
is not busy anymore.

  Paths of boot.

MandrakeMove should work in three different paths of boot:

- mode 1: no USB key

  automatic X configuration, DrakX starts up, asks for language,
  license, asks for a key (we answer we have no key), possibly
  for mouse and keyboard, username/password, auto-detects sound,
  printer and network devices, starts up KDE

  this is a normal live mode, nothing particular

- mode 2: USB key but doesn't yet contain MandrakeMove files

  automatic X configuration, DrakX starts up, asks for language,
  license, set up configuration files on the key, possibly asks
  for mouse and keyboard, username/password, starts up KDE

  once KDE is booted, we are in full Move move, in which user
  data and system configuration data are saved on the usb key

  the USB key is mounted on /home, and some symlinks are created
  from a selection of /etc system files to a per-host directory
  on the USB key (based in /home/.sysconf)

  a daemon is monitoring modifications made to /etc, and
  transparently copy modified/new files to the USB key; hence
  Mandrake Move is much extensible, any modification on /etc will
  be saved

- mode 3: USB key, contains MandrakeMove files

  - 3.1: we are running on the same machine

  DrakX GUI not even shows up as we use existing configuration
  files, we set up stuff of the usb key (/home etc) and we start
  up KDE

  - 3.2: we are running on another machine

  We use language, username/password, and homedir from USB key,
  but other system configuration need to be re-asked:

  automatic X configuration, DrakX starts up, possibly asks for
  mouse and keyboard, starts up KDE
