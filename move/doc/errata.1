<p align="justify">Some users have encountered problems
installing or using MandrakeMove due to specific configuration
situations that we did not have an opportunity to fully test.
Please use the patches or recommendations included below for each
scenario if it applies to you.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Note on using Patches:</b> To use any of
the <i>patch.pl</i> patches that are noted below, you must copy the
appropriate patch onto a floppy disk, with the name patch.pl.
Then you can boot off of your CD-ROM with the "linux patch"
command at the boot prompt (obtained by pressing F1 at the splash
screen), and making sure that the floppy containing the patch is
in the floppy disk drive.</p>

<i>Error scenario:</i> <b>no program seem to see my webcam, whereas on
regular Mandrake 9.2 it works perfectly (may apply to other USB
devices as well).</b>

<br><i>Why:</i> "hotplug" automatic loading of drivers is disabled due to a
bug on our side.

<br><i>Solution:</i> add the following to the last line of
/etc/rc.d/rc.local :
<pre>
sysctl -w kernel.hotplug=/sbin/hotplug
</pre>
and be sure to plug your webcam after boot and KDE startup is
finished, not before booting.

<br><i>Solution for download version:</i> run the following
command in a console at the end of KDE startup, and then plug in
your webcam:
<pre>
sysctl -w kernel.hotplug=/sbin/hotplug
</pre>

</p>
