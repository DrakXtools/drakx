- fix reinstalling grub2 on UEFI (mga#15695)

Version 1.28 - 18 September 2012, by Per Øyvind Karlsen

- drop 'lsparts', it's usefulness over just invoking 'blkid' directly is rather
  questionable
- ship with correct gconv modules for lib64
- replace 'ftp' with 'ncftp' as it's more user friendly and doesn't pull in
  additional library dependencies
- don't bother shipping host as together with it's dependencies pulled, it
  increases size of the compressed squashfs image by almost 1MB alone, without
  providing much additionally useful functionaly..
- use scp from dropbear rather than openssh
- open rescue-gui on tty1

  have any need for
