== rpmsrate ==

'rpmsrate' file is used to 'define categories' of packages. In each categories
there is a list of packages, with a weigth from 1 to 5. All packages with
weight >= 3 will be installed by default.  Be sure to use the correct package
name in rpmrate file, it's case sensitive.  Before adding a package, check it
is not already present in the 'rpmsrate-raw' file, if already, try to use the
previous definition, and if you can't, use the same weight.

some syntax examples:
  * !CAT_XFCE !CAT_KDE homebank
    - install 'homebank' only if XFCE and KDE categories are not selected
  * META_CLASS"powerpack"
    - if you want to be able to install a package 'only' on a 'powerpack'
  * CAT_KDE || CAT_GNOME || CAT_XFCE openoffice.org-openclipart
    - install openoffice.org-openclipart if KDE, GNOME or XFCE are selected
  * CAT_GNOME gnome-audio
    - install gnome-audio if GNOME is selected
  * !LIVE dasher
    - if it is a liveCD 'don't install dasher'
  * TYPE"64bit" DRIVER"^snd_" lib64alsa-plugins
    - install lib64alsa-plugins if it is a '64bits box with sound'
  * HW"ACR38" acr38u
    - if 'ACR38 hardware' detected, 'install acr38u' package

To convert an rpmsrate-raw to an rpmsrate you have to use 'clean-rpmsrate' from
the mkcd package.  You 'must' do your 'change' in the 'rpmsrate-raw' file,
because rpmsrate is generated using it.  The 'clean-rpmsrate' script will
expande languages when needed and remove all comments.

== check rpmsrate ==
Before commiting your rpmsrate, please check it:

$ perl -I /usr/lib/libDrakX -Mpkgs -e 'pkgs::read_rpmsrate_raw($ARGV[0])' PATH_TO_rpmsrate/rpmsrate

error will be displayed. Common error are:
  * a package listed twice in different categorie with different weight
  * no weigth
  * bad categories definition


== compssUsers.pl ==

This file describes wich categories will be displayed in the individual package
installation step.  There is some check, to preselect some categories (laptop,
server etc...).

IE:
--
  { label => N_("Database"),
    descr => N_("PostgreSQL or MySQL database server"),
    flags => [ qw(DATABASES DATABASES_SERVER) ],
    default_selected => 1,
  },
--

The Database word will appear in the individual package selection. It will be
selected by default, so according to flags: CAT_DATABASES CAT_DATABASES_SERVER
will be selected by default in the rpmsrate.
