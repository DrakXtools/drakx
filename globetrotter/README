        Mandrakelinux GlobeTrotter, powered by LaCie Mobile Hard Drive project
        ======================================================================



Requirements:
=============

1) packages:
------------

you need to have the distro repositery mounted in /export.

on top of the mdk10.0 base + its updates, the following packages were
updated from cooker:

- misc bug fixes:
  o drakconf-10-13mdk
  o {drakxtools,harddrake}*-10-34mdk
  o mdkonline-1.0-7mdk
  o menudrake-0.7.4-8mdk
  o netprofile-0.6.3-1.1mdk (for fixed profiles)
  o perl-Libconf*-0.33-2mdk
  o rpmdrake-2.1.3-4mdk
  o initscripts-7.06-49.1mdk:
    * usb starting when usb host drivers were loaded by initrd
    * globetrotter support
    * fix larsen on laptops
- root=LABEL=foobar and boot from USB support:
  o mkinitrd-3.5.18-10mdk 
  o bootloader-utils-1.7-1mdk
- coexistance:
  o glibc with /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ support
  o ATI driver
  o NIVIDIA driver
- new packages:
  o kdetv, libkdevideo
- should we also take new kernel?

Note: once you've updated some packages, you need to run "gendistrib
      /export".


2) local checkout of drakx:
---------------------------

you need a copy of gi/perl-install in ../perl-install as well as
gi/mdk-stage1.

you need to install the following packages: gcc, e2fsprogs,
ldetect-devel, libext2fs2-devel, libxfree86-devel, perl-devel,
perl-URPM, rpm-devel, rpmtools, and urpmi.

then you need to type "make c" in ../perl-install.

last but not least, you need to copy list_modules from gi/kernel into
perl-instéall and gi/mdk-stage1/pcmcia_/probe.c into perl-install/c.



Building the hd image:
======================

just type ./make_live

it'll reformat the hard disk, mount it and install packages
