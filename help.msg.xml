                  <green>Welcome to <blue>Mandrakelinux</blue> install help</green>

In most cases, the best way to get started is to simply press the <yellow>&lt;Enter&gt;</yellow> key.
If you experience problems with standard install, try one of the following 
install types (type the highlighted text and press <yellow>&lt;Enter&gt;</yellow>):

 o  <white>vgalo</white> for low resolution graphical installation.
 o  <white>text</white> for text installation instead of the graphical one.
 o  <white>linux</white> for standard graphical installation at normal resolution.
 o  <white>expert</white> for expert graphical installation at normal resolution.


To repair an already installed system type <white>rescue</white> followed
by <yellow>&lt;Enter&gt;</yellow>.

You can also pass some <white>&lt;specific kernel options&gt;</white> to the Linux kernel. 
For example, try <white>linux noapic</white> if your system has trouble operating
your network adapter correctly.
<red>NOTE</red>: You cannot pass options to modules (SCSI, ethernet card) or devices
such as CD-ROM drives in this way. If you need to do so, use expert mode.
