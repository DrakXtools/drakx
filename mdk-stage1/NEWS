- do reboot using 'reboot' from busybox rather than manually go through the
  process ourself
- fix 'Go to console' to actually spawn a shell rather than just exiting
  rescue-gui
- disable SPAWN_SHELL, there's no need for this crippled shell when we now have
  a lot more complete shell provided by busybox available
- as we no longer load rescue mode from a separate squashfs image, don't try
  prepare for fetching it from any specific media
- don't try mount squashfs image for stage2 installer
- dynamically link binary rather than statically
- add firmware loader written in C (based on hotplug2) (mga#6323)

  provided the architecture in the URL
- fix URL passed to stage2 when user didn't provide the arch in the
  install path (mga#6823)

  than linking it through a static library

- log any errors from init scripts to /var/log/stage1.log
- removal of stage1 files conflicting with files from stage2 is now
  automatically handled by init scripts
