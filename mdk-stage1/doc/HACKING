If you have to boot pretty often, you'll appreciate to speed the things up
a little.

Here's what we use: the GRUB feature to boot from the network using the
DHCP protocol and the TFTP protocol.

Here's the "menu.lst" to do that:

-=-=--

timeout 0

title linux
dhcp
tftpserver 192.168.1.17
kernel (nd)/tftpboot/gc/vmlinuz ramdisk=32000 vga=788
initrd (nd)/tftpboot/gc/network.rdz

-=-=--


The option "tftpserver" is used to override the tftpserver address given
as an answer by the DHCP server. That way, you'll not need to bother your
system administrator to modify his dhcp server configuration.

The directory /tftpboot seems to be the only one defaultly accepted by the
server, and its subdirs.


Of course, your GRUB needs to be compiled with the specific code for your
network card; use ./configure --help in the GRUB build dir for more infos.
