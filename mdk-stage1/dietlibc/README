diet glibc to statically link programs that don't need all the bloat
from glibc.

malloc, printf and scanf contributed from Olaf Dreesen.

Usage:
	gcc -I~/dietlibc/include -Os -pipe -c *.c
	gcc -nostdlib -o ncp ~/dietlibc/start.o *.o ~/dietlibc/dietlibc.a

If you use the glibc includes, directory reading (and maybe other
functions) will fail.  You have been warned!
