	of a drive)

	* modules.pm (load): ignore error in loading prereq's
	
	* modules.pm (@drivers_by_category): rcpci instead of rcpci45,
	z85230 added

	* commands.pm (mount): add modules::load_deps otherwise the
	fs::mount won't succeed insmoding vfat if needed

	* install2.pm (main): add a callback on SEGV
	-> message printed
	-> that way, ENDs are called (otherwise skipped)

	* install_steps_interactive.pm (setup_thiskind): handles the undef
	value returned by load_thiskind
	
	* install_steps_interactive.pm (exitInstall): do not call
	install_steps::exitInstall

	* install_steps (exitInstall): removed
	* install_steps (END): added (it does ejectCdrom)

	* install_steps_interactive.pm (load_thiskind): returns undef if
	error loading a module

	* fs.pm (format_part): changed the prototype from $;$@ to $;@
	otherwise, @options always have a value (mostly undef) and mkdosfs
	fails (with "mkdosfs", "/dev/hdXX", undef, "-F", 32)

	* install_steps_interactive.pm (setup_thiskind):
	add a $auto_probe_pci that overrules $o->{auto_probe_pci}
	(that way no pci probe the second time)

2000-02-10  François Pons  <fpons@mandrakesoft.com>

	* heavy modification of build_archive and extract_archive to manage
	a TOC directly in archive file, handle bzip2 or gzip compression,
	extract_archive can extract multiple files a time, with minimal
	invocation of uncompress program and follow symlink and expand
	directory contents.
	* use build_archive/extract_archive for locales.
	* fixed a min/max in install_steps_gtk for Resize/Create partition.
	* fixed adjustEnd with dos partition table, take care of magic 63
	sectors at beginning of partitions, a more solid method should be
	used for that.

	* modules.pm (load_thiskind): skip modules "unknown" and "ignore"

2000-02-09  Pixel  <pixel@mandrakesoft.com>

	* partition_table.pm (add): cdie if maximum number of partitions
	handled by linux is reached

	* Xconfigurator.pm (chooseResolutionsGtk): display the graphic
	card or server found

	* install_any.pm (relGetFile): for mdkinst files, take care not to
	have a double '/' (see debbugs #591)

	* install_steps_interactive.pm (configureNetwork):
	purpose: add ability to configure both modem and lan
	         clean up the behaviour

	* fs.pm (write_fstab): 
	purpose: sort the fstab per mount point (cuz /usr must be before /usr/local)
	also: rewrite of the part writing the fstab.
