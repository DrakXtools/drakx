	* heavy modification of build_archive and extract_archive to manage
	a TOC directly in archive file, handle bzip2 or gzip compression,
	extract_archive can extract multiple files a time, with minimal
	invocation of uncompress program and follow symlink and expand
	directory contents.
	* use build_archive/extract_archive for locales.
	* fixed a min/max in install_steps_gtk for Resize/Create partition.
	* fixed adjustEnd with dos partition table, take care of magic 63
	sectors at beginning of partitions, a more solid method should be
	used for that.
