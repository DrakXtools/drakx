	* standalone/drakboot: handle no bootloader configuration found with a
	clean error

	* fs/loopback.pm, any.pm, diskdrake/interactive.pm, fs/get.pm, pkgs.pm,
	fs.pm, install_steps.pm, standalone/drakautoinst, bootloader.pm,
	fs/dmraid.pm, install_steps_interactive.pm, network/thirdparty.pm,
	fs/type.pm, install2.pm, common.pm, modules.pm, fs/format.pm,
	fs/mount.pm, commands.pm, install_any.pm, fs/wild_device.pm,
	standalone/bootloader-config, partition_table.pm: try to cleanup fs.pm
	(to have simpler dependencies between modules, esp. have some modules
	only required by diskdrake):
	  - move some functions from fs to fs::mount
	  (most keep their name, except mount_part and mount_usbfs)
	  - move formatMount_part and formatMount_all from fs to fs::format
	  - move some functions from fs to fs::wild_device
	  (part2wild_device_name -> fs::wild_device::from_part)
	  (subpart_from_wild_device_name -> fs::wild_device::to_subpart)
	  (analyze_wild_device_name -> fs::wild_device::analyse)
	
	  - formatMount_part(), formatMount_all(), fs::mount::part() don't take
	a prefix anymore
	  the current situation was quite muddy
	  we now rely on fs::get::mntpoint_prefixed() which will maybe depend on
	a field in $part
	  for now, we mount every part in chroot, it seems to be what's wanted
	
	  - fs::format::part() now expect $all_hds instead of $raids
	
	  - fs::type::carryRootLoopback is now fs::get::carry_root_loopback()
	  - in fs::loopback, most functions don't want a prefix anymore

	* standalone/drakpxe: 
	  - since we don't use a ramdisk for the stage2 anymore, remove
	ramdisk_size=128000
	(hopefully the initrd doesn't have the limitation or we won't hit the
	stupid low default max size of the kernel)
	  - use the short aliases for automatic stage1 (cf
	mdk-stage1/automatic.c)

	* tools/drakx-in-chroot: help getting rid of existing files

	* any.pm: get rid of the few remaining $LD_LOADER

	entry from a native PostScript PPD.

	the ugly gtkset_mousecursor_wait() done on destroy is not called often

	not support it

	* share/po/br.po: typo fix

	kernel (it
	wasn't in our pcitable due to the lack of MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE)
	ivtv & zaptel dkms packages were renamed

2005/01/10  Pablo Saratxaga  <pablo at mandrakesoft.com>

	* share/po/gl.po: updated Galician file

2005/01/10  Pixel  <pixel at mandrakesoft.com>

	* ugtk2.pm: move some now common things in _create_window()
	more installing special install shortcuts in _create_window()
	(there is no reason for not having the shortcuts when the window has
	pop_it)
	  - XFdrake test is not standalone, it is the non install nor standalone
	state
	(used when there is no window manager)
	  - get rid of now unused $ugtk2::force_center
	use {icon_no_error} instead of {icon}
	rewrite
	rewrite
	the test is not useful, we can't get to this code when $::isEmbedded is
	set
	emove unused feature
	$ugtk2::pop_it is unused

	* Makefile: dont_run_directly_stage2 and trace_stage2 needs the live, not
	the clp
	  - add vera fonts (normal and bold)
	  - generate fonts.dir and fonts.cache-1
	  - take cursor.pcf.gz from system

	* share/list: add /etc/fonts/fonts.conf

	* share/fonts.tar.bz2: 
	  - remove cursor.pcf.gz (now taken from system)
	  - generate fonts.dir and fonts.cache-1

	* interactive/gtk.pm: simplify using {pop_it}

	* rescue/list: rsync is useful too
	add what Lord Packdrakeng.pm request
	minimal ssh tools (alas it doesn't on console 1 because /dev/tty is
	allocated properly, it needs fixing)

	* Xconfig/test.pm: 
	  - XFdrake test is not standalone, it is the non install nor standalone
	state
	(used when there is no window manager)
	  - get rid of now unused $ugtk2::force_center

	* share/rpmsrate: simplify

	* rescue/tree/etc/inittab: use "mingetty --autologin" instead of calling
	directly "bash --login", that
	way the shell has a valid controlling terminal (CTTY, accessed via
	/dev/tty).
	This is needed for ssh to work

	* rescue/tree/etc/rc.sysinit: have /dev rw (eg: for /dev/initctl)

	* mygtk2.pm: create {icon_no_error}

2005/01/10  Rafael Garcia-Suarez <rgarciasuarez at mandrakesoft.com>

	actually installed.

	* standalone/drakbackup: Don't use deprecated urpmi --X option

	* standalone/drakTermServ: Silent install of terminal-server if needed
	(--X is deprecated)

	merge Window and Dialog creation
	allow setting padding for pack_start, but only globally (it works like
	spacing, but also include spacing at beginning, and at end)
	add {position_policy} for Window

	* network/tools.pm: remove unused variables

	* fs.pm, install_steps.pm: fs::formatMount_all() parameter wait_message is
	no more optional (though you can give undef)

	* loopback.pm, diskdrake/interactive.pm, install_steps_interactive.pm,
	raid.pm, fs/format.pm: 
	  - fs::format::part_raw() now takes $wait_message to allow displaying
	the progress of format
	  - create fs::format::wait_message() which creates a $wait_message
	valid to give to fs::format::part
	  - fs::format::mke2fs() format while parsing the output to display the
	progress

	* mdk-stage1/tools.c: it's cleaner to have the clp_tmpfs in /tmp
	(i think it was already that way for move and that i broke it, but who
	knows?)

	* install_any.pm: no clp is not an error
	move mdkinst.clp on hard drive ASAP

	* share/list: ldd doesn't say anymore which file ld-linux is, so adding it
	explicitly

	* interactive/gtk.pm: better layout:

	* pkgs.pm: simplify and speed up computeGroupSize()
	in computeGroupSize()
	  - fix old ugly bug (CAT_FOO && CAT_BAR || CAT_FOO  was reduced to

	  - create select_default_packages()

	rescue/list.x86_64: move libperl.so from list.ARCH back to list, using a
	wildcard

	* fs/type.pm: for sunos:
	  - "SunOS swap" and "Whole disk" don't use ufs
	  - drop isSunOS(): replace it with testing {fs_type} eq 'ufs'
	create isEmpty() and use it instead of simply testing {pt_type}, since
	{pt_type} can be undef whereas {fs_type} is set
	don't use pseudo fs_type "apple" for Apple Bootstrap partitions, better
	only use {pt_type} for non mountable partitions

	* fs/get.pm, diskdrake/interactive.pm, diskdrake/hd_gtk.pm: create
	isEmpty() and use it instead of simply testing {pt_type}, since
	{pt_type} can be undef whereas {fs_type} is set

	* lang.pm: fix typo (thanks to bugzilla #12387)

	* fsedit.pm, partition_table/lvm_PV.pm: handle more nicely raw_lvm_PV
	(don't simply ignore them)

	* partition_table/empty.pm: empty partition table means sectors #0 and #1
	are zeroes, not simply sector #0
	(this gives a chance to raw_lvm_PV which has its magic on sector #1)

	* partition_table.pm: handle more nicely raw_lvm_PV (don't simply ignore
	them)
	don't die in will_tell_kernel() when the device is weird, since it is
	normal when destroying a raw_lvm_PV
	enhance readability
	create isEmpty() and use it instead of simply testing {pt_type}, since
	{pt_type} can be undef whereas {fs_type} is set

	* detect_devices.pm: update ppc kernel modules detection & loading
	cleanup get_mac_generation()

	* tools/make_mdkinst_stage2, tools/mdkinst_stage2_tool: major switch from
	ramdisk to clp
	  - make_mdkinst_stage2 is now mdkinst_stage2_tool
	(we don't keep the live when building the clp, mdkinst_stage2_tool is
	able to create the clp from the live, or the live from the clp)

	* partition_table/raw.pm: fix yaboot detection

	* bootloader.pm: rename get_of_dev() -> dev2yaboot()
	don't write boot OF in /tmp/of_boot_dev, better use dev2yaboot() instead
	  - create yaboot2file() and use it
	  - update read_lilo() for yaboot
	  - update write_yaboot()
	  - remove {useboot}
	  - set {boot} to /dev/sda1 in suggest() instead of handling it in
	write_yaboot()

	* Xconfig/card.pm: enable UseFBDev in X configs on ppc, for rage128 and
	radeon
	set raw_LINES on every fglrx devices
	drop broken code
	  - setting VideoRam for i810
	  - unsetting UseFBDev for r128 on ppc

	* modules.pm: update ppc kernel modules detection & loading

	* mdk-stage1/disk.c, mdk-stage1/tools.h, Makefile, mdk-stage1/cdrom.c,
	mdk-stage1/config-stage1.h, rescue/Makefile, mdk-stage1/directory.c,
	mdk-stage1/Makefile, docs/README, mdk-stage1/tools.c, rescue/.cvsignore,
	rescue/make_rescue_img, mdk-stage1/network.c: major switch from ramdisk
	to clp
	  - mdkinst_stage2.bz2 is now mdkinst.clp
	  - rescue_stage2.bz2 is now rescue.clp
	  - make_mdkinst_stage2 is now mdkinst_stage2_tool
	(we don't keep the live when building the clp, mdkinst_stage2_tool is
	able to create the clp from the live, or the live from the clp)
	  - all stage1 images now need cryptoloop & gzloop
	  - the clp can be preloaded in memory or not (see
	MEM_LIMIT_DRAKX_PRELOAD and MEM_LIMIT_RESCUE_PRELOAD)
	  (for http & ftp, it *must* be preloaded)
	  - we don't uncompress the ramdisk anymore since the decompression is
	done on the fly, this makes the rescue boot much faster
	  - function get_ramdisk_realname() is replaced with macro CLP_FILE_REL

	* pkgs.pm: enhance analyse_kernel_name(), esp. to handle i686-up-64GB

	* any.pm: don't write boot OF in /tmp/of_boot_dev, better use dev2yaboot()
	instead

	* tools/Makefile: make_mdkinst_stage2 is no more, hail mdkinst_stage2_tool

2004/11/16  Thierry Vignaud  <tvignaud at mandrakesoft.com>

	* standalone/service_harddrake, harddrake/data.pm: on startup, redo ethX
	aliases

	unify LDFLAGS_INIT and LDFLAGS_STAGE1
	remove GLIBC_LDFLAGS_STAGE1 and DIETLIBC_LDFLAGS_STAGE1 since they were
	not used everywhere,
	and so it was not easy to understand
	drop unused INIT_LIBC, GLIBC_LIBC, DIETLIBC_LIBC (all 3 were empty at
	the moment)

	* tools/ddcprobe/Makefile: disable ddcprobe again - it doesn't work right,
	causing the installer to halt
	with a divide by zero error

	* share/themes-galaxy.rc: the color of the categories of steps is better
	in the theme
	(it was the only part not defined in the theme but in the code)

	* mdk-stage1/Makefile: build init using $(DIET) just like stage2-* (needed
	for ppc, and nicer),
	unify LDFLAGS_INIT and LDFLAGS_STAGE1
	remove GLIBC_LDFLAGS_STAGE1 and DIETLIBC_LDFLAGS_STAGE1 since they were
	not used everywhere,
	and so it was not easy to understand
	drop unused INIT_LIBC, GLIBC_LIBC, DIETLIBC_LIBC (all 3 were empty at
	the moment)
	don't use minilibc.h on ppc
	simplify arch dependent config based on dietlibc vs glibc.
	this patch may be wrong for ppc which now used dietlibc but may prefer
	init-libc-headers.h over minilibc.h
	(need testing)
	some defines are not arch dependent

	* install_gtk.pm: the color of the categories of steps is better in the
	theme
	(it was the only part not defined in the theme but in the code)
	fix converting the background color

	(as was done in save_stuff_for_rescue())
	RAMDISK_LOCATION_REL is a better name than RAMDISK_LOCATION

	* Makefile: do not gzip pm files anymore (since we will soon use
	compressed loopback, this is not useful anymore)
	create install/stage2/mdkinst.kernels which contains the list of kernels
	known by stage2.
	this replaces looking at install/stage2/live/modules/modules.cz-xxx
	(why? cuz install/stage2/live is going to be removed!)

	* printer/printerdrake.pm: 
	  - Special treatments for print queues with the "lbp660" and "ml85p"
	drivers. Here the driver communicates directly with the printer instead
	of sending the output to a CUPS backend.
	  - Make sure that queues which have special treatment, as for example
	the ones using "lbp660" and "ml85p", do not try to open message indows
	when the print queues are auto-generated by dynamic/hotplug.
	  - If the user gets an error/warning message during setup of a queue
	with special treatment, he is automatically put back to the previous
	step in the add-printer wizard.
	  - Let warning messages (funktion "ask_warn()") never embed in the
	add-printer wizard, as they have no "Previous" button in the wizard.
	Fixed "ask_from_()" calls in "config_cups()" (Thanks Olivier for
	breaking it in your perl-checker clean-up in 1.119 --> 1.120).

	* standalone/listsupportedprinters: Added "listsupportedprinters", a
	simple program which runs the printer model list function of
	printerdrake to get a list of supported printer models on STDOUT (Mainly
	for auto-generation of Mandrakelinux hardware support database).

	* standalone/printerdrake: Version number.

2004/08/13  Olivier Blin <oblin at mandrakesoft.com>

	* share/rpmsrate: add list of providers for modem connexions in INSTALL
	section

	* network/network.pm (write_interface_conf) do not write undefined MAC
	address in iftab

	* any.pm: add and use bootloader::set_append_netprofile() and
	bootloader::get_append_netprofile()
	remove old linuxconf profile code
	(setupBootloader__entries) allow to choose net profile in advanced mode

	* standalone/drakvpn: perl_checker fix (add missing spaces)
	do not assume drakvpn is already configured if the tunnels file is
	made of comments only

	* ugtk2.pm: ctrl-alt-delete allows to restart install

	* bootloader.pm: add and use bootloader::set_append_netprofile() and
	bootloader::get_append_netprofile()
	remove old linuxconf profile code
	add remove_append_dict

	* standalone/drakupdate_fstab: drakupdate_fstab: add debug mode that dumps
	argv, device list and fstab
	to make bug reports easier
	(device_name_to_entry) remove unused $variable
	(device_name_to_entry) if device looks like a devfs device, set
	$e->{devfs_device} to $name even if the device wasn't found in devices
	list (it helps in case the device has been removed in del mode)
	(device_name_to_entry) remove useless assignment
	(device_name_to_entry) in non devfs case, $e->{device} always equals
	to $name, move this test in devfs case
	(device_name_to_entry) don't do brain twisted things
	($e->{prefix} || $e->{device}) equals $prefix
	$prefix . $nb equals $name
	(device_name_to_entry) fix indentation
	(device_name_to_entry) define $nb locally
	(device_name_to_entry) recompute $e->{device} only when needed
	(device_name_to_entry) do devfs things where they should be done
	(device_name_to_entry) define $e->{devfs_prefix} if entry looks looks
	like a devfs one but isn't found in device list (else our computed
	$e->{devfs_device} will be crappy)

2004/08/13  Pablo Saratxaga  <pablo at mandrakesoft.com>

	* share/fonts.tar.bz2: changed arabic font to roya.ttf (from
	fonts-ttf-arabic-farsi) which
	also cover Farsi (fa).
	updated Nimbus Sans L to cooker version, and edited it to add
	the two missing letters needed to full latin and cyrillic coverage
	(the two letters were latin schwa (for Azeri) and cyrillic che
	with descender (for Tajik))

2004/08/13  Pixel  <pixel at mandrakesoft.com>

	* bootloader.pm: 
	  - bootloader::remove_append_dict() is not useful,
	bootloader::set_append() can do the same
	  - don't modify anything before "Ok" is clicked
	  - set_append with $netprofile eq '' will remove parameter PROFILE=xxx,
	which is what we want

	* install_steps.pm: 
	  - don't use compssUsers anymore, use compssUsers.pl
	  - code to display compssUsers choices is now in compssUsers.pl
	  - {compssUsers} is now a list instead of a hash, and so drop
	{compssUsersSorted}
	  - rename {compssUsersChoice} to {rpmsrate_flags_chosen} (better name)
	  - i18n_compssUsers is no more needed, add share/compssUsers.pl* to
	ALLPMS
	  - move installing acpi and acpid directly in any::setupBootloader()
	instead of doing
	it in summaryAfter(), that way acpi and acpid are installed in drakboot
	(bugzilla #10760)
	  - if no acpi parameter, don't try installing acpi & acpid (fix for
	ppc)

	* install_steps_gtk.pm: perl_checker compliance
	  - don't use compssUsers anymore, use compssUsers.pl
	  - code to display compssUsers choices is now in compssUsers.pl
	  - {compssUsers} is now a list instead of a hash, and so drop
	{compssUsersSorted}
	  - rename {compssUsersChoice} to {rpmsrate_flags_chosen} (better name)
	  - i18n_compssUsers is no more needed, add share/compssUsers.pl* to
	ALLPMS

	* share/compssUsers.pl, Makefile.config, share/compssUsers, pkgs.pm,
	install2.pm, share/po/Makefile, share/po/i18n_compssUsers,
	install_any.pm, Makefile, install_steps_interactive.pm: 
	  - don't use compssUsers anymore, use compssUsers.pl
	  - code to display compssUsers choices is now in compssUsers.pl
	  - {compssUsers} is now a list instead of a hash, and so drop

2004/08/13  Rafael Garcia-Suarez <rgarciasuarez at mandrakesoft.com>

	* pkgs.pm: perl_checker fix
	Concision, good (says perl_checker)
	Try to copy associated synthesis when a custom hdlist path is given

	* standalone.pm: Remove a perl compilation warning

	* install_steps.pm, install_steps_interactive.pm: Don't ask for the
	selection of supplementary media in non-interactive
	installs.

	* install_any.pm: One further step towards the ftp supplementary media
	Don't ask for the selection of supplementary media in non-interactive
	installs.

2004/08/12  Funda Wang <fundawang at linux.net.cn>

	* lang.pm: Hong Kong -> Hong Kong SAR

2004/08/12  Olivier Blin <oblin at mandrakesoft.com>

	* share/gen_locales.pl: revived, still needed since installer can't make
	symlinks on read-only stage2, and we can't easily workaround it by
	modifying LC_* variables

	* network/netconnect.pm: kill unused variables
	kill deprecated parts
	set both NET_DEVICE and NET_INTERFACE in automatic lan configuration
	(network install)
	set NET_DEVICE and NET_INTERFACE for lan and adsl dhcp/manual
	connections

	* share/gen_locales.sh: still needed since installer can't make symlinks
	on read-only stage2,
	and we can't easily workaround it by modifying LC_* variables

	* network/network.pm: write interface MAC address in iftab
	errm, don't commit crappy gnome proxy handling for now
	(write_interface_conf) simplify HWADDR assignment and define
	$mac_address (will be used later for /etc/iftab)

	* mdk-stage1/init.c: restart forked process if it exits with
	exit_value_restart as return
	code (thanks to Rafael for the choice of its value, 0x35 is the
	translation of RS, abbreviation of ReStart, in his local l33t dialect,
	and happens to be 53 in its decimal form, which is quite nice)
	reorder else if blocks, it's useless to do two times the same test
	(WEXITSTATUS(wait_status) == exit_value_proceed)
	use a do while loop to wait for forked process

2004/08/12  Pablo Saratxaga  <pablo at mandrakesoft.com>

	from modules.cz files, load these modules when not in standalone mode
	(they're needed for install and Move)

	* network/netconnect.pm: fix wording
	do not force kppp installation, it will be installed by
	modem::ppp_configure if kdebase is installed,
	else ifup/ifdown scripts are enough
	kill set_cnx_script usage, replace cnx_scripts with ifup/ifdown
	write a cnx_script for adsl connexions too (so that drakconnect can
	establish the connexion), add a FIXME comment to remind it is bad

2004/08/04  Pixel  <pixel at mandrakesoft.com>

	* standalone/bootloader-config: don't allow unknown kernel names to mess

	(it tends to create stupid alt_xxx entries)
	  - fix creation of labels alt2_alt_xxx (will now be alt2_xxx)
	  - don't create bad "linux-nonfb" for kernel-win4lin
	try to keep the order of kernel options (to help same_entries())
	handle win4lin kernels

	(nb: beware, one must write 07IceWM instead of IceWM, same for others)
	don't set /etc/sysconfig/desktop anymore, configure ~/.wmrc,
	~/.gnome2/gdm and ~/.desktop instead

	* rescue/list: replace /sbin/mkraid with /sbin/mdadm (as told on cooker by
	Luca Berra)

	disable the connect button if up interface is found (there is
	currently no reliable way to find the gateway interface)
	code factorization, do not use system() but fork() and exec() since we
	don't

	* fsedit.pm: change_pt_type() must return a boolean value

	* standalone/bootloader-config: make_boot_splash is no good since the same
	initrd is used with or without vga=,

	so call add_boot_splash directly

	* standalone/harddrake2: enforce introduction of translators hints into
	translation catalogs
	(perl_checker should have been loudly complain on those!!!! :-():
	  - add missing coma caracter
	  - move them near translations
	note that i didn't bother check po comments that already have the proper
	comma. instead this should be done by perl_checker which should warn
	about po
	comments out of translation calls and tags contexts
	display more data about hard disks (geometry, number of primary/extended
	partitions)

	* network/netconnect.pm, standalone/drakTermServ, standalone/drakbackup,

	filtering them out once we've
	detected them in order to prevent tem to appear in the "unknown/other"
	category
	ethernet card detection: only rely on driver for matching ethernet
	cards, thus
	preventing mislisting of other/unwanted devices (eg: bluetooth, wlan,
	AX25).
	last but not least, it enables us to catch
	ldetect/ldetect-lst/detect_devices
	bugs where some devices are *not* seen by drakx and drakconnect.
	remove useless filtering in bridges detection code since proper
	filtering (for
	dobles) is already done at the upper level.

	replaced nvnet on 2004-01-21 in MDK10's ldetect-lst)

2004/06/10  Thierry Vignaud  <tvignaud at mandrakesoft.com>

	* network/netconnect.pm: first lan step: replace the "manual choice"

	include missing header for uname
	in ftp install, check that modules for the boot kernel are available in
	mdkinst live location (they won't be used by the installer, but if they
	aren't here, they probably won't be in the mdkinst tarball)

	* mdk-stage1/url.h, mdk-stage1/url.c: list only the requested file in

	* mdk-stage1/stage1.c, mdk-stage1/init.c: nasty kernel now gives us weird
	PIDs, so we can't rely on this to detect if we are running

	cleanup)

	* mouse.pm: hid is missing (and not needed) on kernel 2.6.7.0.rc2

	* mdk-stage1/dietlibc/Makefile: 
	  - fix build on gcc 3.4
	  - much nicer detection of wether $ARCH/Makefile.add modifies CFLAGS or

	* fsedit.pm: disallow lvm on / with no /boot until lilo handles it

	* install2.pm: tentatively fix lilo with lvm on /

	* bootloader.pm: 
	  - always generate a precise entry using the precise version
	  - remove the linux-2.4 or linux-2.6 entries which don't work together
	with the precise version entry
	  - still have the "linux" entry

	* install_steps_interactive.pm: nice fix for installing locales-XX
	corresponding the chosen country (using packagesProviding())
	workaround code trying to install locales-nb (bugzilla #8287)

	(log_output__real) splited from log_output(), insert text into
	textview at once

	unlike the later, it create named tags, thus reducing tagtable size
	from 30000+ tags to 10-20, thus speedup logdrake in quite a big way.
	
	it should probably replace gtktext_insert in mdk10.1 since all
	gtktext_insert users really have quite a few tags (eg: 1 for
	harddrake2 and rpmdrake)
	(parse_file) speed up it by 20% (#8412) but logcolorize is the top one
	in profiles

	* standalone/drakboot: list yes/no for autologin in a more intuitive way,
	that is yes is
	grouped with user and wm pull down menus (robert.vojta@qcm.cz, anthill

	now support it: we had mga tdfx r128
	radeon, and i810 also works (tested on a i865))

	* standalone/icons/wiz_default_left.png: remove $draw2 (in ugtk2.pm) and
	wiz_default_left.png which are unused

	* install_steps_gtk.pm: rename $ugtk2::force_center used at install with
	$ugtk2::force_center_at_pos
	the boolean $ugtk2::force_center value used standalone is kept as before

	* mouse.pm: use protocol "ExplorerPS/2" instead of "auto" for kernel 2.6
	(not statisfying since people booting with kernel 2.4 will not get a
	working
	mouse, but at least we can test if this really works nicely for 2.6)

	* standalone/harddrake2, standalone.pm: $::noBorder is deprecated (it was
	the same as !$::isInstall)

	* ugtk2.pm: 
	  - rename $ugtk2::force_center used at install with
	$ugtk2::force_center_at_pos
	the boolean $ugtk2::force_center value used standalone is kept as before
	  - deprecate $::noBorder (it was the same as !$::isInstall)
	  - deprecate $ugtk2::force_position (unused AFAIK)
	
	  - _create_window() now returns the created window, it doesn't assign
	{rwindow}
	  nor {window} anymore. It doesn't handle a Frame for the window
	  (it is now directly done by ugtk2->new which is the only function
	using _create_window())
	
	  - deprecate option no_interactive_objects (unused AFAIK)
	
	  - {rwindow} is a VBox for both isWizard and isEmbedded
	  (when isEmbedded, a HBox was created, replacing the create VBox)
	
	  - call ->set_title on $::WizardWindow so that the title is honored in
	non embedded wizard
	
	  - remove $draw2 and wiz_default_left.png which are unused
	
	  - remove ->set_uposition on $::WizardWindow for install. This is not
	needed
	  anymore since force_center_at_pos now works on $::WizardWindow
	
	  - hoist $::WizardTable creation
	
	  - explicitly set the size of the window during install. The chosen
	value is
	  the same as before +9 pixels for the height
	  (the size needs to be fixed since the advertising images must fit)
	
	  - remove the callbacks on expose_event and delete_event for non
	embedded wizard.
	  they are the same as the one in _create_window()
	  (except for the delete_event which explicitly destroy the window, is
	that ok??)
	
	more questions:
	  - ->set_title on a plug may break, it needs testing
	  - flush() just after Gtk2::Plug->new, is it needed? (since there is
	another flush())

	using _create_window())
	
	  - deprecate option no_interactive_objects (unused AFAIK)
	
	  - {rwindow} is a VBox for both isWizard and isEmbedded
	  (when isEmbedded, a HBox was created, replacing the create VBox)
	
	  - call ->set_title on $::WizardWindow so that the title is honored in
	non embedded wizard
	
	  - remove $draw2 and wiz_default_left.png which are unused
	
	  - remove ->set_uposition on $::WizardWindow for install. This is not
	needed
	  anymore since force_center_at_pos now works on $::WizardWindow
	
	  - hoist $::WizardTable creation
	
	  - explicitly set the size of the window during install. The chosen
	value is
	  the same as before +9 pixels for the height
	  (the size needs to be fixed since the advertising images must fit)
	
	  - remove the callbacks on expose_event and delete_event for non
	embedded wizard.
	  they are the same as the one in _create_window()
	  (except for the delete_event which explicitly destroy the window, is
	that ok??)
	
	more questions:
	  - ->set_title on a plug may break, it needs testing
	  - flush() just after Gtk2::Plug->new, is it needed? (since there is
	another flush())
	(gtk_TextView_get_log): handle errors

	* standalone/harddrake2, standalone.pm: $::noBorder is deprecated (it was
	the same as !$::isInstall)

	* interactive.pm: 
	  ->ask_from_entry and ->ask_from_entries are better with focus_first

	* do_pkgs.pm (ensure_is_installed): file to test if the package is
	installed is optional.
	But in that case, you have to check if it is installed first.

2004/01/16  Damien Chaumette  <dchaumette at mandrakesoft.com>

	* standalone/drakconnect: * manage interfaces:
	  - fix Ok button logic
	  - fix some calls to $apply
	* manage interfaces
	  - added Modem page
	  - most of the GUI in place

2004/01/16  Pixel  <pixel at mandrakesoft.com>

	* network/shorewall.pm: fix N() badly used
	  - add icmp support
	  - add "Echo request (ping)" choice

	* network/drakfirewall.pm: 
	  - add icmp support
	  - add "Echo request (ping)" choice

2004/01/16  Stew Benedict  <sbenedict at mandrakesoft.com>

	* standalone/drakbackup, standalone/drakTermServ: ask_warn fixes per
	Thierry, purge some old, unused code

2004/01/16  Thierry Vignaud  <tvignaud at mandrakesoft.com>

	* network/tools.pm: prevent faillure when trying to dereference undef in
	testing mode

	* install_steps_interactive.pm (Accept) default to accept in testing mode
	do not complain about root password in testing mode

	* network/adsl.pm, network/isdn.pm, network/ethernet.pm: do not export
	dead functions

	* share/po/da.po: rollback bogus change
	remove arrows from previous/next buttons according to interface team

	* network/modem.pm (ppp_configure) reintroduce it for drakconnect's
	manager

	* network/network.pm: do not alter proxies config while configuring
	network interfaces (needed since
	we've disabled proxy config in network interface config path)
	do not install zeroconf if no zeroconf hostname was typed in (we may add
	a
	USE_ZEROCONF variable to /etc/sysconfig/network instead)

	* network/netconnect.pm: new host settings step
	clean horrible code
	split/merge lan config steps according to new specs
	(card => protocol => parameters => hostname)
	rollback "separate standalone and install paths" try (just too painful
	to
	maintain and anyway install net wizard has no logic)
	  - make a real step out of "manage multiple internet connections" case
	  - factorize and fix accessing to this step
	drop proxy configuration step.
	rationale:
	  - miscellaneous_choose() was reintroduced in network::network since it
	was still
	  needed by drakproxy
	  - anyway configuring proxies is:
	  o not supposed to be done while configuring network interfaces
	  o duplicated with drakproxy and the like
	  o removed in new drakconnect specs
	morph hw_account step through reusing new wizard layer capabilites (aka
	dynamically return just build needed data rather than ackwardly puting
	it in
	place)
	fix ppp_first_step() call
	small reindenting
	remove overrided variables
	enable to step forward after to "connect now?" step since wizard
	infrastructure fixed the ask_yesorno design flaw (and remove bug hint
	left by
	previous maintainers)
	use wizard layer 's yesorno type
	typo fix

	do not abuse global namespace (this also allow to track variables
	usage through static code analysers such as perl_checker)

2004/01/15  Fabian Mandelbaum  <fabman at 2vias.com.ar>

	* share/po/es.po: Updated Spanish translations

2004/01/15  Pixel  <pixel at mandrakesoft.com>

	* install_steps_gtk.pm: fix individual package selection (was broken since
	30 september...)
	formatList is imported, no need to get it in common::

	* c/stuff.xs.pl, diskdrake/interactive.pm, fsedit.pm,
	install_interactive.pm, partition_table/raw.pm, partition_table.pm: 
	  - remove the use of BLKRRPART (telling the kernel to re-read the
	partition table) in most cases
	  - replace with tell_kernel() and will_tell_kernel()
	  - correctly handle in standalone the need to reboot, with no way to
	forget it
	(telling the WM to quit nicely then call reboot when it's done)

	* rescue/list: insmod.old is needed when the kernel is a 2.4

	* lvm.pm: adaptation/simplification for new lvm2 (thanks to Luca Berra)

	* share/rpmsrate: have hylafax-client installed when kdebase-kdeprintfax
	is selected

	* bootloader.pm: don't modify {append} after add_kernel(), call
	add_kernel() directly with the append parameter
	(so that comparison with previous entries is done correctly)

	bootloader: just complain about the actually used bootloader
	warly said that we should not restrict ourselves to lilo
	make splash config looks better when embedded

	button layout

	* share/po/fr.po: update
	update

	* drakxtools.spec: 9.3-19mdk

	* network/network.pm (miscellaneous_choose) restore it for drakproxy (we'd

	use class->new rather than new class style
	minor cleanup
	perl_checker cleanups
	proper indenting

	(process) in yes/no case, keep the same logic as

	detect_devices::matching_driver -> matching_desc but matching driver
	names (kernel modules)

	  - "<-Previous" => "Previous"
	enable to access extra buttons $w->{buttons}{<label>}
	do not pack empty label before extra buttons if there'll be no button
	before it
	rationale: when there's no cancel button, packing an empty label
	instead of the cancel button results in extra buttons (eg: help,
	advanced) to be shifted with a space before;

	it quite a lot better than we)

	* install_steps_gtk.pm: don't display a watch when slow things because due
	to the
	large number of gtkflush(), the ask_ok_cancel appears
	before its Gtk->main is called, hence clicking too fast
	will call Gtk->main_quit before Gtk->main, but the dialog
	doesn't disappear; then on the next click on ok/cancel,
	the call to another Gtk->main_quit will lead to two
	Gtk->main being exited, hence destroying the ok/cancel
	dialog but alors the main window (choose of individual
	packages)

	(interface team request)
	if no dm is installed, then switch back to expert mode behaviour and
	display
	all dm and install them if needed.
	explanations now work again thanks to pixel, no need to duplicate them

	requires perl-Gtk2 >= 0.95-6mdk for working XSetInputFocus()
	since we renewed network profiles feature, we shall require netprofile
	for
	drakconnect

		  Also, for multilayout keyboards, it would be nice to also
		  in XkbOptions "compose:rwin" to define the right windows
		  key as the compose key (unless "rwin_toggle" has been
		  choosen to toggle the layouts) "compose:rwin" is the

2003/08/26  Thierry Vignaud  <tvignaud at mandrakesoft.com>

	* drakxtools.spec: more last bits for 9.2-2mdk for lord pixel
	9.2-2mdk

	* standalone/drakconnect: still more dialogs cleanups
	add --gui in order to start in "mcc" state (aka not in wizard mode)
	more dialog misusage and some indent fixes
	enfore gc style for gtk+2 widgets creation
	more layout fixes: cance/ok order coherency, no VBoxes/HButtonBoxes
	abuses, ...
	(configure_net) Gtk2::Dialog main area is already a vbox, so it's
	useless to pack a vbox there idem for action area and Gtk2::HButtonBox
	(get_intf_status) kill duplicate
	net & lan configuration dialogs: prevent one to do concurrent config
	changes from the gui
	(sensitive_buttons) fix it
	  - only allow to run one wizard at once (insensitive button if one is
	already started)
	  - reload the configuration once the wizard exited
	  - prevent one to do concurrent config changes from the gui while the
	  wizard is run (proper fix involve both fix modality/transcientness
	  when embedded and running the wizard within the same process instead
	  of forking it]

	* modules.pm (add_alias) override current setting when adding an alias

	* harddrake/sound.pm, standalone/service_harddrake: while bootstrapping,
	only write /etc/modules.conf only if we really altered it
	(thus preventing depmod to be runned everytime)

2003/08/26  François Pons  <fpons at mandrakesoft.com>

	* pkgs.pm: get selected list from compssUsers for readCompssUsers.

	* install_steps_interactive.pm: drop security level selection for desktop
	user.
	do not ask user for group selection if desktop meta class is used.

	* share/compssUsers.server: added [selected=server] for groups to be
	selected by default.

	* share/compssUsers: added [selected=default] for all section which needed
	to be selected
	(approximative map of existing packages).

	* install_any.pm: added default compssUsers group selection from
	compssUser file directly (use
	[selected=...] where ... is a list of comma separated meta_class (or
	default for
	no meta_class or all for all meta_class).
	fixed all radeon card are using 3D for 3D package group.

	* share/compssUsers.desktop: added [selected=desktop] when needed (same as
	default selection (PowerPack) but
	Gnome is removed).

	* standalone/diskdrake: do embed WebDAV configuration (fix bug #4703)

	* any.pm: install "autofs" pkg when using ldap (thanks to Buchan Milne)

	* diskdrake/dav.pm: focus_first on the webdav server field

	* keyboard.pm: 
	  - don't set XkbCompat to group_led, it's better to use grp_led:scroll
	in
	XkbOptions
	  - also set compose:rwin if GRP_TOGGLE is not rwin_toggle. rationale:
		  Also, for multilayout keyboards, it would be nice to also
		  in XkbOptions "compose:rwin" to define the right windows
		  key as the compose key (unless "rwin_toggle" has been
		  choosen to toggle the layouts) "compose:rwin" is the
		  default when loading a single latin layout, but is lost
		  when loading several layouts...

	* fs.pm: use fs=ext2:vfat or fs=udf:iso9600 for supermount (it needs
	supermount-ng)

	* printer/main.pm: Distinguish between printers "Configured on this
	machine" and
	"Configured on other machines", not any more "Local Printers" and
	"Remote Printers", so the current dialog is compatible to the new GTK2
	dialog.
	Fixed recognition of installed parallel HPOJ-driven MF devices.

	* printer/cups.pm: Distinguish between printers "Configured on this
	machine" and
	"Configured on other machines", not any more "Local Printers" and
	"Remote Printers", so the current dialog is compatible to the new GTK2

	dialog.
	  - Modularized the function main() to have separate subroutines for
	adding, setting as default, editing, and removing a printer (for new
	  main window).
	  - Cleaned up the code of the former function main().
	  - Re-activated the wizard mode for adding a printer, it works again!

	* printer/main.pm: Adapted version mark in HPOJ config files to the
	current HPOJ.
	  - Fixed expert/normal mode switch (it will perhaps be removed, but a
	working switch makes the further development easier).
	  - Added connectionstr() function which produces a human-readable
	  string for the connection type, needed for new main window.
	  - Added missing parantheses (there was a warning complaining about
	this).

	* printer/printerdrake.pm: Made the HP DeskJet 450 really being recognized
	as a printer needing HPOJ.
	Added HP DeskJet 450 to the models which need HPOJ.

	* ugtk2.pm: as discussed with david, gc, laurent & pixel early this week,
	since
	gtk+ dialogs are HIG-ed and since most drakxtools' explicit gtk+
	windows follow cancel/ok order for now, let implicit windows (that is
	interactive written ones) follow the same order in standalone mode.
	after release, we'll have to make ugtk2 handle one more abstractions,
	that is taking some buttons callbacks, add buttons that have callbacks
	and pack them in kde or gnome order depending of interface team
	decision or maybe of runtime detection of desktop.

	* standalone/icons/non-editable.png: add new icon for drakperm

	* standalone/drakperm: rename $treeModel as $model since it really is a
	ListModel, not a
	TreeModel anymore (cosmetic)
	  - disable up button when selected rule is the first one
	  - disable down button when selected rule is the latest one or when
	next rule is non editable
	always add newly created setting at top of editable settings so that
	we're we can sort them since they're no non editable items between old
	& new editable ones
	once we start to alter settings ordering, we need to save it on exit;
	so just tell it to drakperm
	  - fix gtk bug on moving down line
	  - merge moving up & down callbacks
	  - we do not have a hierarchy, so just use a s/tree/list/

	* share/po/fr.po: a few more translations
	translate last remaining non translated languages with google help

	* drakxtools.spec: 9.2-0.35mdk

	* fs.pm: when umount fails, try killing fam and trying again

	* diskdrake/resize_ntfs.pm: display the error returned by ntfsresize (need
	i18n though)

	* Xconfig/card.pm: don't propose XF3 when $force_xf4
	fix typo ($::force_xf4 doesn't exist anymore)

	* ugtk2.pm: only access $::o->{mouse}{unsafe} during install

	* partition_table.pm: 
	  - fix call to openit()
	  - replace *F with $F

	* fsedit.pm: simplify
	allocatePartitions() resulted in a small unallocated area at the end of
	the
	drive when:
	  - suggest_part() reserves some room for the other partitions which are
	going to
	be added next. For maxsize limited partition, it reserves maxsize (if
	maxsize
	is reached)
	  - suggest_part() which adds the last partition limited by maxsize can
	be
	called on a partition a little bigger than maxsize due to cylinder
	boundary
	adjustments on previous partition creations. In that case, it doesn't
	use the
	full area.
	It occured for example with the current $fsedit::suggestions{server}.
	The fix chosen is to ensure the last suggest_part() is called with a
	size
	defined as maxsize <= size < maxsize + cylinder_size.

	* standalone/draksec: fix english (thanks to Reinout van Schouwen)

	* bootloader.pm: don't overwrite $o->{bootloader}{method} (much nicer for
	auto_installs)

	* install_steps_interactive.pm: more complete name for the setRootPassword
	step: "Set root password and
	network authentication methods" instead of simply "Set root password"

	* interactive/gtk.pm: OptionMenus do not have an horizontal scroll-bar.
	This can cause havoc for

	(eg: diskdrake Create dialog box in expert mode) (bug #4484)

	which were dead symlinks
	(to /etc/alternatives/something)

	  - copy /etc/mtab to /mnt/etc/mtab to have a nice chrooted "mount" or

	* install2.pm, install_steps.pm, network/smb.pm,
	install_steps_interactive.pm: 
	  - move write_smb_conf() from install_any to network::smb
	  - rename setAuthentication() to set_authentication()
	  - move the work of set_authentication() from install_any to any
	  - move the per-authentification kind questions from

	any::ask_authentification_parameters()
	  - various cleanup in code prompting authentification questions
	  - call install_any::set_authentication() in

	instead of waiting for the installPackages step to be done
	  (since setRootPassword occurs *after* packages installation)
	  - don't call set_authentification() in install_steps::addUser()
	  (why was this done there??)

	add drakauth

	* Xconfig/xfreeX.pm, Xconfig/parse.pm, Xconfig/xfree4.pm,
	Xconfig/xfree3.pm: => do as Chris Picton suggested
	Chris Picton said (nearly one year ago :-/) :
	I have found the need for many low res screen resolutions for such
	thingas as movie playing, xmame, etc.
	
	The method XFdrake uses to enable modes is to enumerate each mode in the
	XF86Config file. For example (a newly created file):
	
	Subsection "Display"
	    Depth 24
	    Modes "1280x960" "1152x864" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
	EndSubsection
	
	It would be better (at least under XFree 4, which automatically provides
	resoltions from the monitor, if it is capable), to not limit the modes
	provided to the user
	
	If I use instead, the following:
	
	Subsection "Display"
	    Depth 24
	    Virtual 1280 960
	EndSubsection
	
	My maximum mode is exactly the same as before, but I have many more low
	resolution modes.

	* any.pm, install_any.pm:

	* drakxtools.spec: 
	  - drakxtools-newt must not require perl(interactive::gtk) or
	perl(ugtk2)
	  - only drakbackup require perl(Net::FTP) & perl(Time::localtime), i
	don't want
	this require for all drakxtools. What about moving drakbackup to a

	* ugtk2.pm: intermediate commit to completely broken ugtk2 for handling
	tree, in order for
	gc or pixel to fix this...

	* pkgs.pm: allow testing locally, should not avoid pkgs to work in real
	place.

	* install_steps_interactive.pm: removed remaining code of eval (eq nop).
	remove eval around choosePackagesTree as it display something even if it
	doesn't run...

2003/07/30  Pablo Saratxaga  <pablo at mandrakesoft.com>

	* share/po/cs.po, share/po/he.po, share/po/sq.po: updated Albanian, Czech
	and Hebrew files

2003/07/30  Pixel  <pixel at mandrakesoft.com>

	* network/network.pm: revert to 1.129:
	it's no good removing " (using module ...)" from {DEVICE} field, it's
	much
	  better not having it in the first place. See network/ethernet.pm v1.81
	for
	  the real fix

	* install_steps.pm: Aurora doesn't exist anymore (and it's been that way
	for quite a few time)

	* network/ethernet.pm: fix typo (thanks to perl_checker)
	cleanup (especially ensure $interface is not something like "eth0 (using
	module ...)" but only "eth0" (cf network/network.pm 1.130 nasty change)

	* timezone.pm: 
	  - cleanup
	  - add pool.ntp.org (and make it the default) (cf bug #4197)

	* install_steps_gtk.pm: ensure "No details" is displayed instead of
	"Details" when beginning a new
	package installation round and "No details" was pressed in previous
	round

	* any.pm: perl_checker compliance
	  - cleanup debug code
	  - use read_gnomekderc & update_gnomekderc instead of getVarsFromSh &
	substInFile
	allow other=/dev/fd0 (bug #4405)

	* Xconfig/test.pm: 
	  - move from perl-GTK2 to perl-Gtk2
	  - fix an old weird typo

	* install_steps_interactive.pm: fix typo
	  - cleanup
	  - add pool.ntp.org (and make it the default) (cf bug #4197)

2003/07/29  Frederic Crozat  <fcrozat at mandrakesoft.com>

	* docs/README: remove some really obsolete doc

	* fsedit.pm: re-export %fsedit::suggestions as needed (why did titi my-ed
	it?) (fixes bug #4298)

	* install2.pm: use formatError for the error message occuring when
	auto_install.cfg is bad

	* drakxtools.spec: there is no good url for drakxtools, but at least don't
	give a broken one!
	(thanks to Raul Dias)

	* ugtk2.pm: labels are not able to correctly handle long texts, so
	rollback to using
	TextView instead.
	For information on this pb:
	  - IHM team doesn't like TextView because the text can be selected, and
	a
	contextual menu is available
	  - IHM team doesn't like the difference between small text (using a
	Label) and
	longer text (using a TextView)
	  - Label can wrap automatically but not nicely (it doesn't use the full
	width)
	  - Label can't wrap CJK text which have no spaces
	Apart from this Label vs TextView pb, Titi only left some code which
	takes
	care of small text, causing the text to be wrapped using warp_text
	(which is
	not proportional font aware) and not using a scrolled window (causing
	the
	license to take more than the screen, the buttons disappearing at the
	bottom
	of the screen)

2003/07/28  François Pons  <fpons at mandrakesoft.com>

	* share/list.i386: moved mkfs.xfs

	no problem.

	* standalone.pm: avoid being clashed by signature checking when installing
	packages,
	need a better fix later.

	* interactive/gtk.pm: tempory fix for title not having scroll bars (which
	sounds reasonable ?), as the
	size of the window is fixed the low part of the window is not visible.
	titi who makes the portage to newer Gtk2 has not tested this (again, for
	info).

2003/07/22  Pablo Saratxaga  <pablo at mandrakesoft.com>

	* standalone/drakconnect: mcc view: add an help button (and ugtk2-ize main
	window buttons btw)

	* network/netconnect.pm: add a hint if we never restore profiles feature
	do not gratuitously waste space
	if we really want the type connection to be translated by translate()
	call in
	step_2, we should mark it as translatable for gettext somewhere ...
	fix final success message:
	  - fix join usage
	  - fix gtk frontend detection
	do not loop if one refuse to save changes, just skip the save step
	keep user changes on back step
	fix no previous button when using ask_okcancel() in wizard mode due to
	*very*
	ugly "$common->{cancel} = '' if !defined wantarray();" in interactive.pm
	anyway, the whole pre_func() idea was totally dumb
	it now looks a little cleaner
	
	
	
	making all main configuration callbacks having the same prototype and
	name
	would enable further cleanups (direct call to
	network::$net_module{$type}::configure(...);)

	  - describe all security levels
	  - make it clean than security admin is not a security level
	  - colorize security levels names
	  - use a label instead of textview

	(_create_dialog) default is "as much as needed" size
	perl_checker fixes

	intercept buggy callees/users of bool type that wrongly pass label
	instead of text

	* fsedit.pm: now swap is before / on client node

2003/07/16  Pixel  <pixel at mandrakesoft.com>

	* commands.pm, swap.pm, Makefile: remove mkswap from commands.pm, so no
	need anymore to have mkswap_ (the drawback is that the mkswap command
	won't create the device anymore)

2003/06/06  Guillaume Cottenceau  <gc at mandrakesoft.com>

	the gettext is not forced to utf8

	* diskdrake/interactive.pm: fix typos + perl_checker fixes

	* standalone.pm: don't use N() so early
	(beware, this removes translation, some translate() calls must be
	added!)

	next 9.2-0.3mdk bits
	fix #3485

	* network/netconnect.pm: kill some warnings catched by diagnostics pragma

	* standalone/drakconnect: gtk+-2 specs prohibid playing with policy
	(build_list) simplify ip parsing
	workaround #3341: display "Bad ip" instead of a blank field if ip
	wasn't correctly parsed as an ip ?

	* standalone/drakbug: do not mix interactive and ugtk2, let reusse
	create_dialog()
	do not set twice the title, ugtk2->new already do it for us
	remove unused variable
	gtk+-2 specs prohibid playing with policy
	(quit_global) inline it
	  - further clean gui construction through functionnal ugtk2
	  - do not gratuitously add:
	o " " around button labels
	  o empty strings at end of kernel release
	  - (parse_release) simplify
	  - there's no need to keep a reference on field that we do not further
	  use (distro release is parsed again when needed and kernel release
	  is already stored in some variable)
	  - do not pack nothing to widgets
	  - simplify gui construction through create_packtable(), we really do
	  not have to offuscate it like c programmers have to
	  - one shall not be able to alter kernel or distribution release number

	* harddrake/data.pm: do not fork usb module drivers list but reuse
	list_modules one instead

	* standalone/scannerdrake (removeverticalbar) pixelate
	perl_checker fixes

	further bits for 9.2-0.1mdk
	first bits of 9.2-0.1mdk

	* printer/printerdrake.pm: 
	  - perl_checker fixes, which show up the following bugs:
	  - printer::printerdrake::{setup_smb,setup_socket}(): do not use undef
	  values, but reuse those we just calculate
	  - printer::printerdrake::main(): fix printer::default::printer_type()
	  callee
	
	  - printer::printerdrake::check_network(): fix
	  network::netconnect::main() callee

	* network/nfs.pm (find_servers): chomp is uneeded
	(find_exports) better behavior when regexp does not match

	* standalone/harddrake2: better explanation of the wp field

	* standalone/draksplash: perl_checker fixes

	* printer/detect.pm, standalone/printerdrake: perl_checker fixes
	printer::printerdrake::{setup_smb,setup_socket}(): do not use undef
	values, but reuse those
	we just calculate
	printer::printerdrake::main(): fix printer::default::printer_type()
	callee

	* my_gtk.pm: fix #3952: do not pass extra argument (gc altered
	common::take_screenshot() api in r1.172 but forget to alter all
	callees)

	* standalone/drakfont: try to simplify
	(put_font_dir): $/variable is unlikely what was initially intended
	(chk_empty_xfs_path): typo fix
	(search_dir_font_uninstall): further simplify
	(chk_empty_xfs_path):
	  - any { !cdt} equals to every { cdt }
	  - if_ is unneeded
	
	(search_dir_font_uninstall) map { if_(cdt, $_ } equals to grep { cdt }
	(file_ok_sel) prevent potential crash in perl regexp engine if sg bad
	happenned in the translation
	fix #3960: divide by zero execption

	* security/msec.pm: 
	  - fix #3616 (draksec discarding changes)
	  - add a end of line btw at the end of file to please cat

	* standalone/drakedm: fix #1743: offer to restart the dm service

	* printer/main.pm: perl_checker fixes
	printer::printerdrake::{setup_smb,setup_socket}(): do not use undef
	values, but reuse those
	we just calculate
	printer::printerdrake::main(): fix printer::default::printer_type()
	callee
	prevent set_usermode() vs set_cups_autoconf() conflict
	restore service restart

	* .perl_checker: check again printerdrake, this would have prevent whoever
	altered
	network::netconnect::main() to forget some calle when updating all
	calle for new parameters signature :-(

	* bootloader.pm: for whatever reason, the second part of
	detect_bootloader()
	consolidation didn't make up into the cvs

	* modules.pm (probe_category): one regexp is enough for isdn

	* share/po/fr.po: update french translation

2003/05/19  Fabian Mandelbaum  <fabman at 2vias.com.ar>

	* share/po/es.po: updated Spanish translations

2003/05/19  Thierry Vignaud  <tvignaud at mandrakesoft.com>

	* printer/gimp.pm (gimp::pop_spaces): consolidate skipping of lines that
	are space ended
	perl_checker fixes

	* any.pm: in standalone drakboot, raise a wait message window so that the
	user can figure
	out what occurs (lilo installation being quite long)

	* bootloader.pm: fix #3560 (drakboot not updating bootloader label): the
	only confusing
	bug is that when one come back to drakboot main window after having
	altered the bootloader, the main window still list the old bootloader
	as the current bootloader.
	let update this label.
	btw consolidate bootloader detection in bootloader::detect_bootloader()
	further fix #2826 (lilo failling to handle entry with spaces): replace
	spaces by underscores in labels (image names are not likely to contain
	spaces) to prevent the error
	when configuring to install grub bootloader, we first install lilo, then
	grub.
	
	the logic is that we only reread /etc/lilo.conf[1], so we need to write
	/etc/lilo.conf.  but when installing grub, we really do not need to run
	lilo, we
	only have to write its config file.
	
	[1] because grub/menu.lst lacks some data and because we do neither want
	to
	parse both config files nor to resolve conflicts between configuration
	let further consolidate make_label_lilo_compatible()

	* printer/main.pm: 
	  - (read_location, rip_location): simplify loop condition since once we
	get
	$location_end, we exit it
	  - (rip_location): simplify @location build when no existing one
	  - (get_cups_autoconf, set_cups_autoconf, get_usermode, set_usermode):
	simplify
	  a lot through getVarsFromSh() and setVarsInSh()
	
	  - (set_jap_textmode) simplify a lot through substInFile()
	
	now all /etc/sysconfig/printing accesses get done by MDK::Common::File
	(until
	shell template from libconf is used)
	perl_checker fixes

	* standalone/logdrake: dialog window is already modal

	* printer/cups.pm, printer/detect.pm, printer/office.pm,
	printer/default.pm, printer/services.pm, printer/printerdrake.pm:
	perl_checker fixes

	* standalone/drakboot: fix #3560 (drakboot not updating bootloader label):
	the only confusing
	bug is that when one come back to drakboot main window after having
	altered the bootloader, the main window still list the old bootloader
	as the current bootloader.
	let update this label.
	btw consolidate bootloader detection in bootloader::detect_bootloader()

	* network/network.pm: move expert stuff under the "advanced" button like
	in all other drakx/drakxtools code

	* network/nfs.pm: do not drop return values from regexp but use them to
	ensure we do not
	reuse capture buffers from previous one, which is really bad and
	trully buggy

	* lang.pm: %langs: first column is supposed to be localized in english

	* standalone/drakconnect: some drakconnect cleanups

	* standalone/lsnetdrake: simplify

	* standalone/harddrake2: localize drive capabilites (aka burning, dvd
	managment, ...)

	* drakxtools.spec: add a bug reference
	last 9.1-38mdk bits
	update perl-gtk0 users list (drakcronat being ported to gtk+2)

2003/05/16  Damien Chaumette  <dchaumette at mandrakesoft.com>

	  - Update to busybox 0.65.0 version
	  - Add support for x86-64
	Merge back fixes from HEAD but don't use the init_module() et al. tricks

	* drakxtools.spec: first bits of 9.1-31mdk
	fix harddrake menu entry description

	* standalone/drakboot: fix #2826 (aka pixel sucks):
	pixel changed the booloader module api by throwing an exception
	instead of using the ugly /tmp/.error temporary file and altered drakx
	callers but forget to update standalone/* callers (aka drakboot).
	now, with this patch, any error during lilo/grub installation is
	catched and displayed, which is more generic than checking for spaces.

2003/04/02  Guillaume Cottenceau  <gc at mandrakesoft.com>

	* patch/9.1/patch-loopback.pl: Error scenario: When using a file for your
	/ (a "loopback"), booting your newly
	installed system will fail with a kernel panic with flashing keyboard
	lights
	Why: The initrd needs to load the loop.o module to mount your /
	partition; but
	since recently, loop.o depends on aes.o, and since mkinitrd doesn't
	handle
	dependencies automatically and we didn't notice that change, we didn't
	update
	mkinitrd accordingly
	Solution: Format a floppy disk with a DOS filesystem (in Linux, you can
	use the
	command "mkdosfs /dev/fd0"). Copy patch.pl to the floppy disk. Remove
	the floppy
	and reboot using the Mandrake Linux 9.1 CD1 to do a CD-ROM installation.
	During
	boot, press F1 at the splash screen, then place your floppy disk that
	contains
	patch.pl in the floppy drive. At the prompt, type "patch", then follow
	the
	installation as usual.
	
	see bugzilla #3614

	* share/po/nl.po: updated Dutch file

2003/04/02  Pixel  <pixel at mandrakesoft.com>

	* patch/9.1/patch-detectSMP-K6.pl: Error scenario: On a AMD-K6, install
	fails after the formatting partitions steps with a strange "type read"
	error
	Why: in some cases, the SMP detection code fails and force the install
	to exit
	Solution: Use patch.pl which disables SMP detection
	(thanks to Angela Bayley)

	* diskdrake/hd_gtk.pm: 
	  - in focus_in_event for partition buttons, grab_focus is needed
	because gtk2 is buggy. Forcing an expose event would be enough
	  - in button_press_event for partition buttons, grab_focus is needed
	because gtk2 is buggy. The creation of widgets causes the lost of the
	focus
	(fixes part of #2621)

	* share/rpmsrate: move imap to NETWORKING_MAIL_SERVER (bug #2622)

	* rescue/tree/etc/profile: 
	  - unsetting LD_LIBRARY_PATH: setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH to libraries in
	/mnt is
	wrong since the ld loader used (/lib/ld-linux.so.2) won't use the one in
	/mnt,
	causing dependency problems.
	  - removing /mnt dirs from PATH (which are not useful anymore since the
	corresponding libraries won't be found)
	(fixes bug #2554)

	gtk frontend (since it allows one to start/stop services)
	this allows to skip stopping service "dm" (bug #2664)

2003/03/04  Thierry Vignaud  <tvignaud@mandrakesoft.com>

	* standalone/drakboot: remove debuging assertions (as spoted by gc)

	* standalone/drakperm: 
	  - remove last warning

	nop (this need an updated perl-GTK2 though)
	  - let up, down, delete and edit buttons be insensitive when selection
	  is destroyed or when there's no selection
	  - fix #1776 part two (do not insert dummy lines)
	  - restore special lines with current keyword
	  - reuse already defined path

	/etc/ppp/peers/adsl
	or /etc/ppp/options or /etc/ppp/options.adsl.

	* share/po/validate.pl: make it useful
	  - print problems with GREP_COLOR

	  - use saved_default_val dirty hackery to really honour default value
	  - fix not calling $select again when trying to select an already
	selected value (happens when clicking or keyboard-selecting;
	  broken, it ended up in always scrolling the selected value to
	  the center)

	* printer/main.pm, printer/printerdrake.pm: Several bug fixes on
	printerdrake
	  - "BrowsePoll <IP>:<Port>" needs "Browsing On" in
	/etc/cups/cupsd.conf.
	  - If the same printer model is once on the parallel port and second on
	USB,
	there was a new USB queue created on every start of Printerdrake.
	  - Now CUPS is restarted whenever a new USB print queue is set up so
	that
	  CUPS can provide the model-related USB URI.
	  - Made sure that the default printer is defined and that it is an
	existing
	  queue so that during installation printerdrake does not show a line
	only
	  containing " (Default)" in the list of installed printers.
	  - Cleaned up data structure after automatic queue generation.

	* install2.pm: don't log "warning: find_index failed in ..."

	* install_steps.pm, install_steps_interactive.pm: add some more
	formatError

	* raid.pm: mkraid wants all the md devices written in raidtab to exist,
	even if asking to
	create a specific md
	cleanup

	* install_steps_auto_install.pm: add a formatError

	* pixmaps/X.png: add it back (used by XFdrake)

	* install_any.pm: use formatError

	* install_interactive.pm: add some formatError's

	* fsedit.pm, detect_devices.pm: 
	  - cleanup & simplify
	  - handle raid on raid detection

	* interactive/gtk.pm: can't use $mainw->{ok}->clicked since $mainw->{ok}
	doesn't always exist, set
	{retval} and main_quit instead (the way it was done for double click, is
	this
	ok when pressing enter?)

	* diskdrake/interactive.pm: use formatError on $err
	use formatError($err) instead of $@
	  - allow raid on raid (raid 10)
	  - focus mount point in Mount_point
	  - focus type in Type

	* standalone/icons/ic82-tape-40.png, pixmaps/ic82-tape-40.png,
	pixmaps/ic82-systemeplus-40.png,
	standalone/icons/ic82-systemeplus-40.png: move some images from
	standalone to pixmaps to have them both during install and after install
	(images used by XFdrake)

	* install_steps_gtk.pm: indent more the entries in the summary (as asked
	by dadou)

2003/02/19  Thierry Vignaud  <tvignaud@mandrakesoft.com>

	* standalone/drakxtv: 
	  - perl_checker fixes
	  - indent-region, untabify
	  - comment workaround
	workaround a drakx bug which don't always add bttv to /etc/modules

	* standalone/scannerdrake: cleanup
	fix embedding

	* standalone/printerdrake: hide the icon when embedded to get more space
	fix embedding and clean it up

2003/02/19  François Pons  <fpons@mandrakesoft.com>

	* install_steps_interactive.pm: make sure network::network:: is used (just
	in case)
	add default configuration for network for summary.

	mdk-stage1/insmod-modutils/Makefile, mdk-stage1/newt/Makefile,
	mdk-stage1/slang/Makefile, mdk-stage1/mar/Makefile: 
	  - Use minilibc on x86-64
	  - mar requires bzlib to be built beforehand, especially if building
	with
	dietlibc
	  - Nuke trickery to handle -DIET objects, everything is now built
	through
	  the diet driver, defined into $(DIET)

	* mdk-stage1/dietlibc/include/net/ethernet.h: Add <net/ethernet.h> and
	<linux/if_ether.h> so that dhcp.c can be compiled

	* mdk-stage1/dietlibc/dietfeatures.h: Define WANT_TZFILE_PARSER so that
	call to tset() in strftime() implementation
	can be resolved.
	Merge back small config file
	Merge in CVS dietlibc 0.21 for IA-64 and X86-64 support. However, drop
	the
	following architectures we currently don't support: arm, mips, mipsel,
	parisc,
	s390, sparc64.

	parisc,
	s390, sparc64.

	* mdk-stage1/dietlibc/Makefile: dynlinker/ directory is obsolete and dead
	here.
	Fixes for unmerged parts (contrib, examples)
	Merge in CVS dietlibc 0.21 for IA-64 and X86-64 support. However, drop
	the
	following architectures we currently don't support: arm, mips, mipsel,
	parisc,
	s390, sparc64.

	* mdk-stage1/newt/form.c: #include <string.h> for memset()

	* mdk-stage1/Makefile.common, mdk-stage1/Makefile: Use dietlibc on x86-64
	  - Use minilibc on x86-64
	  - mar requires bzlib to be built beforehand, especially if building
	with
	dietlibc
	  - Nuke trickery to handle -DIET objects, everything is now built
	through
	  the diet driver, defined into $(DIET)

	* mdk-stage1/dietlibc/include/sys/types.h,
	mdk-stage1/dietlibc/include/rpc/types.h: Define u_char et al. from
	<rpc/types.h>. The __dietlibc_u_char mechanism

	programs with -D_BSD_SOURCE (u_char et al. are defined in <sys/types.h>

	for __GLIBC__. If none
	of those C library is used, simply abort compilation.

2003/02/18  Guillaume Cottenceau  <gc@mandrakesoft.com>

	* install_steps_interactive.pm: remove unneeded pablo's change on RTL

	* ugtk2.pm: fix titi's perl checko
	internalize prepare_gtk2 in the BEGIN {} of ugtk2 already containing the
	Gtk2->init

	* lang.pm: small change thx to pablo
	reposition main and steps window when in RTL language
	allow to specify font size in output of l2pango_font
	destroy and recreate steps window when charset changed because gtk won't
	update the font size otherwise

	* install_gtk.pm: reposition main and steps window when in RTL language
	allow to specify font size in output of l2pango_font
	destroy and recreate steps window when charset changed because gtk won't
	update the font size otherwise

	* interactive/gtk.pm: internalize prepare_gtk2 in the BEGIN {} of ugtk2
	already containing the Gtk2->init

	* install_steps_gtk.pm: allow to specify font size in output of
	l2pango_font
	destroy and recreate steps window when charset changed because gtk won't
	update the font size otherwise

2003/02/18  Pablo Saratxaga  <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* help.pm: fixed small typo

	* install_steps_interactive.pm: define language direction

	* printer/printerdrake.pm: Removed N( ) around IP numbers, there is no
	point in "translating" them

	* steps.pm: changed "Choose your Language" -> "Language"
	shortened some strings to help them fit in the steps window

2003/02/18  Pixel  <pixel@mandrakesoft.com>

	* partition_table.pm: /proc/partitions includes partition with type
	"empty" and a non-null size
	so add them for comparison
	  - ensure someone can't set a mount point on a non formatted ntfs
	partition
	  - remove the mount point when destructive resizing and isNonMountable

	* diskdrake/interactive.pm: fix ugly bug (the bug was introduced in
	diskdrake/interactive.pm 1.67)
	  - ensure someone can't set a mount point on a non formatted ntfs
	partition
	  - remove the mount point when destructive resizing and isNonMountable

	* interactive/gtk.pm: in {complete} or {canceled}, ensure giving a bad
	entry number to focus doesn't
	break (and log that something wrong happened)

	* interactive/newt.pm: simplify
	fix tree in newt (now handles default selected entry, and disallow using
	non-leaves)

	* diskdrake/resize_ntfs.pm (resize): do a test resize before doing the
	real one

	* any.pm: don't use tmpfs on /tmp if /tmp is a separate partition
	(anyway, all this is ugly, see with titi)

	* install2.pm: simplify

	* install_steps_interactive.pm (setRootPassword): display "Authentication"
	in Advanced
	display the release even when there is only one system to upgrade
	(asked by flepied & warly)

	* ugtk2.pm: the empty label in the HButtonBox had the same size as the
	buttons (since
	HButtonBox are always homogeneous), causing addUser in german not to fit
	on
	the screen. No good way to solve this :-(

	* fsedit.pm: /proc/partitions includes partition with type "empty" and a
	non-null size
	so add them for comparison
	better default partitioning

	* keyboard.pm: translate grp_toggles at display-time, not compile-time

	* Newt/Newt.xs: fix tree in newt (now handles default selected entry, and
	disallow using non-leaves)

	* tools/ddcprobe/ddcxinfos.c: catch bad HorizSync or VertRefresh
	(on Regis's monitor, it gives "62-0 Hz VertRefresh")

2003/02/18  Till Kamppeter  <till@mandrakesoft.com>

	* printer/main.pm, printer/printerdrake.pm: 
	  - "BrowsePoll" support in the CUPS configuration dialog.
	  - Fixes on error message windows in the dialog for printer sharing
	destinations.

	* scanner.pm: Replaced "my" by "our" for the declaration of the
	"ScannerDB" variable, so that /usr/bin/scannerdrake has access to it.

2003/02/18  Thierry Vignaud  <tvignaud@mandrakesoft.com>

	* scanner.pm: perl_checker fixes

	* network/network.pm: perl_checker fix

	* drakxtools.spec: 9.1-1mdk

	* Xconfig/card.pm: bump version on fredl request

	* security/help.pm: resync with msec

2003/02/17  Pixel  <pixel@mandrakesoft.com>

	* install_steps_interactive.pm: fix bug occurring "if no sound card are
	detected AND the user selected things
	needing a sound card, propose a special case for ISA cards"
	(thanks to guran)

	* help.pm: some more fixes (thanks to Edward Cherlin and Reinout van
	Schouwen)

	* security/level.pm: replace %level_list with level_list() so that
	N("...") is called at runtime
	instead of compile-time

	* network/drakfirewall.pm: translate server {name} at display-time, not
	compile-time

2003/02/17  François Pons  <fpons@mandrakesoft.com>

	* fsedit.pm: given default size of / increased.
	increased /var container for suggestion (simple or with /usr).

	* commands.pm: fixed command insmod.

	* install_steps_interactive.pm: add a reboot if not enough free space is
	available for installation or upgrade.

2003/02/17  Guillaume Cottenceau  <gc@mandrakesoft.com>

	* standalone/drakgw: fix translation of title: N() needs to be called
	after
	interactive->vnew has been called

	* steps.pm: fix pixel's commit: never display choosePackages and
	configureServices, instead of always

	* lang.pm: change %countries so that we really have translated countries
	(side effect of #1723 -> noticing this bug)
	disable mn until we have lang-mn.png

	* drakxtools.spec: grüh

	fsck up
	the gui
	  - display all configuration buttons (both internet and lan) the same
	way

	(to have previous XFree's behaviour)

	* fsedit.pm, partition_table.pm: handle 0x7 partition table id specially
	since it can be both hpfs or ntfs.
	so adding 0x107 being really ntfs. hopefully this change won't break too
	much things
	(but things were already broken, since it assigned a mount point with

	    a permission data structure.
	  o no need to keep global references on widget we pack through
	    symbolic references; this is only namespace pollution

	  - language->country is probed, the selection of the country is
	possible
	  if there was a problem, in the Summary step
	  - in the $o big structure, we now use $o->{locale} which contains
	  three keys: lang, country and utf8
	  - lang.pm has been cleaned and rewritten a bit
	  - keyboard probing now done only on language (because this step is
	  at the beginning of the install)
	  - timezone probing done on country, if use changes country before
	  timezone in the Summary, re-probe timezone accordingly

	add possibility to display images in tree-lists and bool-lists

	* mdk-stage1/config-stage1.h: ramdisk is enlarging, move the limit from 52
	Mb to 68 Mb (it won't work properly in gtk on a box with 64 Mb of

	reverting it to default on disk)"
	  - fix emebedding (no transcience when embedded)
	  - fix "value get chop()-ed until it disapear and is reset to default"
	  - log which security level is set and not only the switch
	killing latest remanent parts of christian "yeah baby, i'm piggy"
	work:
	
	  - functions and checks listing :
	  o rename get_functions() as list_functions() and
	    get_default_checks() as list_checks();   this is both
	    more homogenous and enable one to separate them from the
	    get_(check|function)_(value|default) function group
	  o regroup them
	  o over simplify list_functions(): leave functions listing to msec
	    (aka /usr/share/msec/level.<LEVEL>, assuming share/msec.py is
	    always up to date, just don't care reparsing python code (this is
	    plain stupid);  if we cannot rely on msec, on who could we :-) ?
	  o this allow to simplify msec gui so that we do not exclude stuff
	    already excluded
	  - remove config_check(), config_funtion(): replace them by:
	  o set_check() and set_function() to store new values in data
	    structure
	  o apply_checks() and apply_functions() to save these new values,
	    thus writing config files once and not twice the functions &
	    checks count
	now, we always have a help entry and a default value but when fredl
	rename a
	check and forgot to remove it from /var/lib/msec/security.conf like
	CHECK_SUID_GROUP => CHECK_SGID, but hopefully, he'll fix msec

	* share/po/fr.po: typo fix

	  - consolidate file names

	  - rename get_(default|value as load_(default|value)s and alter them so
	that config file are read only one time instead of one per option;
	  data is stocked in package variable
	  - thus get_default_checks() is quite a lot faster

	  - fix check default reading
	  - group default values reading and current values reading
	what's left: do the same thing for writing tomorow

	  must neither fill nor expand, only the packtable should
	display again the first notebook page
	if no default value, then do not print one (aka for cron checks)
	fix help system description.
	we should really use the camille/deush help system though.
	  - perl_checker fixes

	with
	  execessive () was not detected by perl_checker :-( )

	or when switching between PostScript PPD file and Foomatic.
	  - Fixed tree structure of main window in expert mode.

	  - Display options devided in the groups defined in the PPD file.
	  - For Foomatic PPDs the options in the "General" group are shown by
	default
	  the rest when clicking "Advanced". When there ar no groups, the
	decision
	  is done by a table of most commonly used option names.
	  - Sort the displayed options of a queue with a non-Foomatic PPD file
	by the
	  importance of the options.
	  - Do not sort the values of an option, they are already conveniently
	sorted
	  in the PPD files.
	  - Removed some unnecessary re-reads of the printer option information.
	  - Several fixes to run smoothly with Foomatic 2.9.x.

	* harddrake/data.pm: translate topics (aka hw class names) in harddrake
	gui
	  - cosmetic fix for "drakconnect does not detect nvnet part of nvforce2
	chips"
	hint: their class is MEMORY_RAM :-( ...
	  - btw, simplify unknown devices detection (merging tests regarding
	driver and
	  media type)
	  - move nforce system controllers in bridge class (which is renamed
	"bridges and
	  system controllers" aka where we put stuff we've nothing to configure
	but we
	  don't want to put them in controller so that users are not afraid) but
	nvnet

	* standalone/logdrake: on second thoughts, this is just simpler
	  - perl_checker fixes
	  - fix non embedded case :-(

2003/01/30  Pixel  <pixel@mandrakesoft.com>

	* interactive.pm (helper_separator_tree_to_tree): this new function helps
	transforming a
	flag {list} to a tree, using {separator}

	* Newt/Newt.xs, interactive/newt.pm: basic treelist handling (it leaks
	memory, but who cares, compared to gtk :)

2003/01/29  François Pons  <fpons@mandrakesoft.com>

	* standalone/drakpxe: fixed perl_checker

	* network/netconnect.pm: fixed some perl_checker

2003/01/29  Pablo Saratxaga  <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* share/po/da.po, share/po/pt.po: updated Portuguese and Danish files

	* keyboard.pm, lang.pm: switched some languages to UTF-8 (they use ascii
	only, so it shouldn't
	be noticed); changed a keyboard name to match name used by XFree86

2003/01/29  Pixel  <pixel@mandrakesoft.com>

	* share/list: ntfsresize feature added (not tested!)

	* detect_devices.pm, raid.pm: software raid (mdX) can go up to md31

	* diskdrake/hd_gtk.pm: don't set $::main_window during install

	* diskdrake/interactive.pm: fix various resize pbs:
	  - write partition table *before* resizing when partition is enlarged

	dumpe2fs call cleanup
	ntfsresize feature added (not tested!)

	* fsedit.pm: handle mdX where X >= 10 (it should fix bug #1129)

2003/01/29  Till Kamppeter  <till@mandrakesoft.com>

	* printer/main.pm, printer/printerdrake.pm: 
	  - Automatic non-interactive installation of local print queues.
	  - Standard and advanced options selected by option groups in PPD.
	  - Fixed bug of "CUPS + GIMP-Print" drivers being preferred against
	"Foomatic + gimp-print" drivers in beginners mode.
	  - Foomatic package installation adapted to Foomatic 2.9.x.

2003/01/29  Thierry Vignaud  <tvignaud@mandrakesoft.com>

	* standalone/logdrake: logdrake is a special case as for embedding in mcc
	since it can be embedded
	twice: one as explanation viewer and one a log search tool.
	so we must handly ask mcc to display us ...

	* detect_devices.pm (getIDE) don't provide information when we don't have
	it (vendor, description)
	(getModem) it always return an empy hash, thus confusing harddrake

	* harddrake/data.pm: fix doble detection of pci modems
	restore cd/dvd burners detection

	* standalone/harddrake2: print badly managed devices' drivers in red

2003/01/28  Guillaume Cottenceau  <gc@mandrakesoft.com>

2003/01/28  Pixel  <pixel@mandrakesoft.com>

	* Newt/Newt.xs, interactive/newt.pm: cleanup use of flags
	simplify API (always -1,-1 for left,top when creating widget, it means
	auto-placement)

	* any.pm: log configured dvds for better post-debugging

	* diskdrake/interactive.pm: for resize2fs, don't multiply by 512 *then*
	divide by $block_size, better
	divide by ($block_size / 512)

2003/01/28  Till Kamppeter  <till@mandrakesoft.com>

	* share/rpmsrate: Take into account the new splitting of the Foomatic
	packages.

	* printer/main.pm, printer/printerdrake.pm: More stuff for non-interactive
	printer configuration:
	  - Added find_new_printer() function to find local printers which are
	not
	configured yet
	  - Fixed Titi's bugs which messed up list of auto-detected printers
	  - Corrected text in the dialog for changing the printer connection
	type
	  (for local printer connections).
	  - Allow switching to expert mode during installation (the installation
	has
	  no global expert mode any more.

	in logdrake usage help (spoted by Christophe Combelles)

	* interactive.pm, ugtk2.pm, ugtk.pm, interactive/gtk.pm, common.pm:
	cleaning the utf8 support stuff:
	  - consolidate check_for_xserver() to check for x11 access
	  - introduce prepare_gtk2() to do what gtk+2 needs, so that
	  tools that're not part of drakxtools (aka: rpmdrake, mcc, ...) can
	just do :
	
	  unshift @::textdomains, 'drakconf';  prepare_gtk2();

	* harddrake/TODO: update

	* drakxtools.spec: 9.1-0.17mdk

2003/01/27  Damien Chaumette  <dchaumette@mandrakesoft.com>

	* standalone/drakfont: 
	  - progress bars works
	  - change sucky About box
	  - wipeout commented code
	  - remove ugly borders when embedded

2003/01/27  florin

	* standalone/drakgw: typo rename, not renamef

2003/01/27  Guillaume Cottenceau  <gc@mandrakesoft.com>

	* mouse.pm: fix missing pointer_ungrab so that after testing mouse during
	install we can move the mouse pointer everywhere

	* interactive/gtk.pm: since return values of callbacks are now
	non-ignored, we need to
	return 0 to the expose_event when displaying wait message so that
	gdk really does the exposure :)

2003/01/27  Pablo Saratxaga  <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* share/po/vi.po: updated po file

2003/01/27  Pixel  <pixel@mandrakesoft.com>

	* interactive/newt.pm: don't blindly truncate strings to size 40 in
	simplify_string

2003/01/27  Till Kamppeter  <till@mandrakesoft.com>

	* printer/main.pm, printer/printerdrake.pm: Adapted printerdrake to
	Foomatic 2.9.x, bug fix for use of native PPDs in recommended mode, bug
	fixes in association between detected printers and existing queues.

2003/01/27  Thierry Vignaud  <tvignaud@mandrakesoft.com>

	* modules.pm: fix latest source of "unlisted modules" in draksound:
	modules::get_alias() was able to give "module " instead of only "module"
	beacause modules::read_conf() split the line on space with a maximum of
	3
	splited elements.
	i choose to strip terminal spaces and btw terminal comments.
	i did not choose to do not put a limit to split since it's usefull for
	some
	cases.

	* standalone/drakbug: force drakbug to be runnable in strict mode

	* drakxtools.spec: 9.1-0.16mdk
	9.1-0.15mdk
	reput back perl-gtk-0.7 dependancy because of drakfloppy and
	net_monitor

	* standalone/drakxtv: this patch enable doc team to take snapshot of
	drakxtv even if they do not
	have any card:
	  - running "/usr/sbin/drakxtv" will enable to take snapshot of error
	message
	when xawtv wasn't installed by the drakx installer
	  - running "/usr/sbin/drakxtv --testing" will emulate a fake dummy tv
	card
	  so that one is able to take snapshots of configuring a tv card

	* Makefile: roll back (mcc!=gi)
	remove warnings in package

	* standalone/draksec: it's useless to import %security::help::help since
	it's already
	exported by our

	* ugtk2.pm: remove debugging statement
	let mcc pack tables behave smoother, so that all columns of mcc tables
	behave
	like last column of drakx's pack tables
	don't sent USR2 to mcc for logdrake;
	logdrake is handled differently since it's a special case.
	else on first execution of an embedded app, we take two USR2 (one from
	the
	embedded app and one from logdrake, which is bad)

	* standalone/drakfloppy, interactive.pm, standalone/net_monitor: strip
	authentification out of interactive->vnew into common.pm
	This enable apps that still use gtk+-1.2 via my_gtk to still work when
	they only need interactive->vnew('su') just to get root capabilities.
	Indeed, interactive load ugtk if it has access to the X server, which
	make my_gtk and ugtk fight for the cpu forever... which is bad imho...
	drakfloppy and net_monitor were converted to use it and are now usuable
	again
	("i leave ...  again" commit).
	
	it would also enable to complete spec 64 by enabling rpmdrake
	to use kdesu under kde and consolehelper under gnome.
	rpmdrake is indeed the last program to not behave like
	the running desktop to get root capability.
	
	unless someone is against this, i'll convert the mcc and all other gtk+
	pure
	tools to do not use anymore interactive just to get root capability.
	
	
	btw, i fixed the infamous SECTOR_SIZE warning...

	* diskdrake/hd_gtk.pm, interactive/gtk.pm: diskdrake: when non embedded,
	ensure sub window are modal
	all other drakx tool can be fixed the same way

	* share/po/Makefile: since fpons don't care about fixing drakxtools build
	broken by
	drakpxe, let remove drakpxe from translatable files

	* standalone/logdrake: cosmetic fix for embedded mode:
	don't display "wait while parsing" window when embedded
	fix logdrake behaviour in mcc where logdrake would only log
	the first process.
	another (rare indeed) case of a bug introduced because perl_checker
	wanted us to localize a file handle :-(

	* common.pm (require_root_capability): having extracted it from
	interactive enable
	to further simplify it
	strip authentification out of interactive->vnew into common.pm
	This enable apps that still use gtk+-1.2 via my_gtk to still work when
	they only need interactive->vnew('su') just to get root capabilities.
	Indeed, interactive load ugtk if it has access to the X server, which
	make my_gtk and ugtk fight for the cpu forever... which is bad imho...
	drakfloppy and net_monitor were converted to use it and are now usuable
	again

	it would also enable to complete spec 64 by enabling rpmdrake
	to use kdesu under kde and consolehelper under gnome.

	* standalone/harddrake2: make interactive help window be modal, aka
	transcient for main ugtk2
	window
	perl_checker fix
	use new help system

	* network/netconnect.pm: let drakconnect be less verbose: aka explain
	rename of old configuration files
	if that had been already done

	* standalone/drakhelp: 
	  - strict mode
	  - we need at least 1 argument, and only one

	  - don't setMouseLive when the protocol hasn't changed

	* common.pm, c/stuff.xs.pl, interactive.pm, lang.pm: fix non latin1
	post-install perl-gtk2 apps, seems like perl upgrading strings to utf8

	textdomains to utf8 and tag the translated strings to utf8, when using

2003/01/21  Pixel  <pixel@mandrakesoft.com>

	* steps.pm: on error in acceptLicense, go back to selectLanguage (ie.
	handle "Previous ->" correctly)

	* Xconfig/various.pm, Xconfig/card.pm: have Xfree version at only one
	place
	(nb: it would be better to parse available package and get version from
	it.)

	* install_interactive.pm: remove or fix some "Previous"

	* help.pm: "license" is now step "acceptLicense"

	* interactive.pm: when the return value of ask_from_ and ask_from is not
	used, do not have a
	"Previous ->" or "Cancel" button (beware, black magic here :)

	* interactive/gtk.pm: remove unused variable
	(ask_fromW): very smart code to know which widget to focus (dilemna is:
	"Next" vs first widget). One can also force focusing of first widget
	using $common->{focus_first}
	(ask_fromW): have "advanced" widgets above buttons, not below
	(create_list): fix old bug (nb: this code must be unused)
	(create_boxradio): need to set {focus_w} to the selected widget (nb:
	this is ugly)
	(create_boxradio, $may_go_to_next): no special case for "tab", gtk2
	handles things better than gtk1
	($set_all): pass the full_struct to the setters (this allows modifying
	{focus_w}) (nb: this is ugly)

	* install_gtk.pm: enlarge "steps" window a little
	small enhancement to know which step is currently done

	* ugtk2.pm: enlarge "steps" window a little
	(create_okcancel): rework to prepare next move, "Next" and "Previous" on
	the left, and @other buttons on the right
	(create_hbox): do handle the layout parameter

	* install_steps_interactive.pm: replace "Next" button with "Reboot" at
	exitInstall step
	remove or fix some "Previous"
	(acceptLicense): handle "Previous ->" correctly, and simplify code
	(esp. don't set useless_thing_accepted)

	* any.pm (setupBootloader__mbr_or_not): add ability to skip and to put on
	floppy
	rework autologin dialog box
	(selectLanguage): no "Previous ->" during install

	* diskdrake/interactive.pm (Mount_point): use uniq() on suggested mount
	points (otherwise the suggested mount point appears twice) (fixes bug
	#954)

	* install2.pm: don't prompt for license when useless_thing_accepted
	(this used to be done in install_steps_interactive::acceptLicense)

	* install_steps_gtk.pm: workaround set_active on Gtk2::CheckButton widgets
	thinking undef is true :-(
	(hopefully, gc will fix perl-GTK2!)
	replace some "Ok" with "Next ->"

	* Xconfig/main.pm: replace some "Ok" with "Next ->"

2003/01/21  Till Kamppeter  <till@mandrakesoft.com>

	* printer/main.pm, printer/printerdrake.pm: 
	  - Support for manufacturer-supplied PostScript PPDs also in
	recommended
	mode.
	  - If "Foomatic + Postscript" is recommended driver for a printer and a
	  manufacturer-supplied PPD file exists for it, the PPD file gets the
	  recommended driver.
	  - Tried to extract IEEE-1284 auto-detection info from the PPD files
	but
	  this takes too long time (40 sec for 800 PPDs).
	  - Fixed long-standing bug in activation of auto-load of the USB
	"printer"
	  kernel module.

	* printer/printerdrake.pm: 
	  - fix autodetection code (remember me to teach titi that "and" in list

	  - callbacks "Add", "Modify" and "Remove" return undef when they fail
	  - callback "Add" return the new added element (not handled by
	interactive emulation, but correctly handled by interactive::gtk native
	ask_from__add_modify_removeW)

	* interactive.pm: fix call to method ask_from__add_modify_removeW

	* interactive/gtk.pm (create_treeview_list): fix setter
	  - factorize the creation of the {formatted_list} from {list} for
	create_boxradio, create_treeview_list, create_treeview_tree
	  - an added advantage for create_treeview_list is the ability to easily
	change
	{list}, {formatted_list} and Gtk2::ListStore without breaking keyboard
	acceleration (see next commit for a usage of this feature)

	* ugtk2.pm (create_packtable): ScrolledWindow are not the only one allowed
	to grow,
	widgets with get_data('must_grow') set are allowed too

	* printer/printerdrake.pm (first_time_dialog): much cleanup (but not
	tested)

	entries

	* standalone.pm: don't import everything from "common" (including
	MDK::Common::*) to get rid of
	warnings "Subroutine renamef redefined ..." "Subroutine linkf redefined
	..."
	... (but I don't understand how to make explainations on common_functs
	work?!)

	* printer/gimp.pm: 
	  - mkdir_p throws an exception on error, so "mkdir_p() or ..." is dumb,
	fixing
	(thanks to Lea Gris)
	  - use output()

2002/12/24  Pablo Saratxaga  <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* share/po/pt.po: Updated Portuguese file

2002/12/23  Guillaume Cottenceau  <gc@mandrakesoft.com>

	* lang.pm: CJK font names changes (still doesn't work :/)

	* share/list: perl's automatic utf8 handling will need these files (will
	try to do better in the future)

	* install_steps_gtk.pm: fix 'bold' advertisements

	* share/fonts.tar.bz2: use another default font
	have a default fixed alias for a font which will always be here even in
	ramdisk

	* tools/make_mdkinst_stage2: fonts changes (doesn't work with CJK (at
	least) in ramdisk, though)

	* Xconfig/resolution_and_depth.pm: workaround gtk bug in
	gtk_entry_set_text
	fix titi porting gtk2 without testing enough..

	* interactive/gtk.pm: be more efficient in precomputing, previous
	situation could lead to several tens of seconds of wait in
	XFdrake-monitor

2002/12/23  Pablo Saratxaga  <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* share/po/pt_BR.po: updated Brazilian file

2002/12/23  Pixel  <pixel@mandrakesoft.com>

	* printer/printerdrake.pm: help perl_checker (interactive is used even if
	the constructor is not there)

	* Xconfig/resolution_and_depth.pm: fix setting size of depth combo

2002/12/20  Guillaume Cottenceau  <gc@mandrakesoft.com>

	* lang.pm: simplify since we don't use X11 fonts (we can't since
	GDK_USE_XFT is not switchable once program is launched)

	* mouse.pm: image in CVS is 3b+, not 3bp

	* share/themes-mdk.rc: allow gtk2 theme engine to find pixmaps

	* share/list, Makefile: list files changes for gtk2 (is that really
	optimal to have utf8.pm and utf8_heavy.pl?)

2002/12/20  Pablo Saratxaga  <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* share/po/pt.po: updated Portuguese file
	updated Portuguese file

	* share/fonts.tar.bz2: updated fonts tarball, all old bitmap fonts have
	been removed,
	now it only includes:
	  - an OpenType font with glyphs for latin and cyrillic
	  - two unicode encoded bitmap fonts with glyphs for CJK and Greek
	(and it could be used for non latin/cyrillic scripts for which there
	  isn't any outline font available).
	Those fonts are based on fonts shipped with XFree86 (Nimbus Sans L and
	"misc-fixed"), but with some modifications (extra glyphs added to
	complete the "holes" in latin and cyrillic for the outline font,
	added a few missing chines chars and changed ascii portion from
	monospaced
	to varaible width for the bitmap fonts (so the visual output is
	better)).
	The choice of bitmap fonts for CJK has been done due to the very huge
	size of CJK outline fonts.

	* share/po/fi.po: updated Finnish file

	* share/po/eo.po: Small change in Esperanto file

2002/12/20  Thierry Vignaud  <tvignaud@mandrakesoft.com>

	printer::cups::get_formatted_remote_queues()
	  - cleanup printer::cups::get_remote_queues() using

	anymore, use security::level::get() instead (fix titi change)

	* printer/gimp.pm: do not use "$1 !~ ..."

2002/12/19  Thierry Vignaud  <tvignaud@mandrakesoft.com>

	disable embedded mode for now due to gtk+-2 bugs
	fix wizards and draconnect:
	it's the same code as in old my_gtk but i don't understand
	how it could have worked...
	yet the logic is quite simple : we add the "previous" button only if
	we're not in the wizard's first page; but the "next/finish" button
	must still be added, else the wizard is quite unusefull :-(

	* standalone/harddrake2, harddrake/data.pm: saner default size (too big
	for 800x600 sadly)

	* standalone/drakconnect: refresh: remove current interfaces before
	readding them, like it was
	before
	  - consolidate some code into new_dialog
	  - simplify through MDK::Common
	perl_checker fixes
	  - gtk+-2 port is completed (switch from CList to TreeView)

	put back the comment
	(read_cups_printer_list, get_cups_remote_queues): much cleanup

	* fsedit.pm (check): drop it (unused, maybe you should use

	should be removed?)

	* diskdrake/hd_gtk.pm: when clicking on one of the legend buttons together

	* share/po/Makefile, share/po/fake_c.pl: use "perl_checker --generate-pot"
	instead of fake_c + xgettext

	problem using it as reference to file handle.

	* standalone/drakTermServ: Correct typo in create boot ISO code
	Add note in help about optional net boot image entry for PCI cards

2002/10/09  gbeauchesne

	* mdk-stage1/log.c: ISO C standard as to say about va_list on 7.15 [#3]
	If  access  to  the varying arguments is desired, the called
	       function shall declare an object (referred to as ap in  this
	       subclause) having type va_list.  The object ap may be passed
	       as an argument to another function; if that function invokes
	       the  va_arg  macro with parameter ap, the value of ap in the
	       calling function is indeterminate and shall be passed to the
	       va_end macro prior to any further reference to ap.199)
	Which interprets to do reuse a va_list that was already processed.
	Instead, use a copy. This fixes crashes on x86-64 and debugging
	feasible, since logging is now available. ;-)

	* mdk-stage1/minilibc.h, mdk-stage1/minilibc.c: Add support for x86-64 to
	minilibc. But we don't really use it yet, as glibc
	requirements for stage1 undoubtedly make images already bigger. So let
	have
	glibc init there too. ;-)

	* bootloader.pm: I surely don't want nor expect grub and loadlin to work
	on x86-64.

	* share/list.x86_64: Update list for perl mods and XF86 4.2.1 support

	* tools/aewm-drakx/misc.c: Apply FredL change from HEAD

	* mdk-stage1/disk.c: Use standard memset() instead of BSD-ish bzero().

	* mdk-stage1/Makefile, mdk-stage1/Makefile.common: Add x86-64, use glibc
	in init and stage1 as dietlibc is not working enough
	and minilibc for init doesn't seem to let umounting take place at the
	end
	of installation.

	* fs.pm: SYS_umount does not exist on modern kernels and architectures
	like x86-64 :)

	* mdk-stage1/rescue-gui.c: lib64 support

	* tools/aewm-drakx/client.c: Fix get/set_wm_state(), we have to get the
	same data (size) that was set.

	* mdk-stage1/init.c: Add support for lib64 architectures (x86-64, ppc64,
	etc.). Aka native
	libraries are in */lib64 there.

	* install_any.pm: Let's try a real bash prior to defaulting to perl'ish
	/bin/sh?

	* Xconfig/card.pm: Default to XF4 on x86-64 too

	* install_steps_gtk.pm: Yeah, stuck with XFree86 4.X server on x86-64 too.

	* partition_table.pm: Supported journalised FS on x86-64 are ReiserFS and
	ext3fs for now. Though,
	I haven't tested reiserfs and don't expect it to work before next kernel
	update.

	* mdk-stage1/init-libc-headers.h: <sys/ioctl.h> is needed

	* drakxtools.spec: remove symlink Xconfigurator (which was broken anyway,
	thanks to Ian Ventura-Whiting for reporting it)

	* bootloader.pm (same_entries): compare kernel options sorted (this is an
	approximation of
	reality since order can matter, but...). An example is "quiet
	devfs=mount
	hdc=ide-scsi" vs "devfs=mount hdc=ide-scsi quiet" (thanks to Gabriel
	Phoenix)

	or "Save on floppy" in individual package selection

	auto_install's manualFstab)
	handle no options in fs::mount (is it really needed?... it should not!)

	* Xconfig/test.pm: set isInstall in test script otherwise it uses
	/usr/X11R6/bin/xtest

	=> no need to have a locale.cz2 anymore
	  (this is now possible since the number of special cases is lower than
	before)

	* lang.pm: 
	  - remove utf_xxx charsets, adding a flag UTF-8 instead
	  - add during_install__lang2charset
	  - when using ramdisk, no locale.cz2 anymore:
	there are 3 main charsets containing everything for all locales, except
	LC_CTYPE
	    by default, there is UTF-8.
	    when asked for GB2312 or BIG5, removing the other main charsets
	  - cleanup comments (use #- instead of #)
	  - various cleanup

	* tools/make_mdkinst_stage2: no more locale.cz2, just keeping the main
	charset /usr/share/locale/UTF-8

	  - if using devfs, using the new dynamic rawdevice.script script to
	bind a
	rawdevice on demand
	pb: can't have both a devfs and a non-devfs config,
	    the /etc/sysconfig/rawdevices solution gives errors with devfs
	    (since the dvd is not REGISTERed yet)
	please perl_checker
	fix typo
	(devfssymlinkf): use devfs names for devfs/conf.d/xxx.conf, but not for
	the
	symlink in /dev (which is used when devfs is not)
	devfssymlinkf doesn't have any return value, so don't check it

	* Xconfigurator.pm: 
	  - $in and $do_pkgs are no more global

	   (it was applied on the module field of pcitable, instead of the
	description))
	  - dropped modelines_text_Trident_TG_96xx case (it has never been used)
	  - rename %xkb_options into %XkbOptions
	  - rename {DRI_glx} into {DRI_GLX}, the value now comes from Cards+
	  instead of regexp'ing {identifier}
	  - rename {Utah_glx} into {UTAH_GLX}, the value now comes from Cards+
	  instead of regexp'ing {identifier}
	  - rename {Utah_glx_EXPERIMENTAL} into {UTAH_GLX_EXPERIMENTAL}, the
	value now comes from Cards+
	  instead of regexp'ing {identifier}
	  - very_bad_card and bad_card are now the same, the value now comes
	from
	  Cards+ (BAD_FB_RESTORE & BAD_FB_RESTORE_XF3)
	  - drop unused @accelservers
	  - remove $modelines_text_apple, use $modelines_text_ext instead
	  - don't use a <Section "Modes"> together with <UseModes "Mac Modes">,
	put
	  directly modelines in Section "Monitor"
	  (why should ppc behave differently than others!?)
	  - replace (conflicting) ModeLines "1280x1024 @ 74 Hz" and
	  "1280x1024 @ 76 Hz" with "1280x1024 @ 75 Hz" (from ddcxinfos)
	  - drop ModeLine "640x480 @ 72 Hz"
	  (it conflicts, and anyway, it has no real use nowadays :)
	  - drop comments about HorizSync, VertRefresh and ModeLine's from
	  XF86Config
	  - drop many unneeded stuff from XF86Config:
	  AutoRepeat, Xqueue, Xleds, NoTrapSignals, XkbTypes, XkbKeycodes,
	  XkbCompat, XkbRules, LeftAlt/RightAlt/ScrollLock/RightCtl
	  - drop section comments from XF86Config
	  - drop XF86_Mono configuration
	  (it doesn't work anyway, seems like it needs a special ModeLine?)
	  - drop 320x200 with XF86_SVGA (who can use this!?)
	  - do not write Screen section "accel" if the server configured is not
	an
	  accel one
	  - drop the "Generic VGA" Device section for XF4
	  (this device is unused)
	  - drop {monitor}{vendor}, {monitor}{model}, {card}{vendor},
	{card}{model},
	  {card}{board} (only description strings, not useful for running the
	server)
	  - use x_res instead of wres for things like 1024 in 1024x768

	* partition_table_lvm_PV.pm: Allows people having PVs on unpartitioned
	disks to install
	(but no way to create such beasts)

	* Makefile.config: standalone/drakbug doesn't exist! (why did deush add
	it???)
	it is standalone/harddrake2, not standalone/harddrake (poor deush must
	be loosing his brain :p)

2002/07/05  Pixel  <pixel@mandrakesoft.com>

	* fs.pm (prepare_write_fstab): for supermount, have "none" as the device
	(cleaner, and
	more coherent with the "supermount" script (tx to FredC))

2002/07/05  Thierry Vignaud  <tvignaud@mandrakesoft.com>

	* install_steps_interactive.pm: minimize startup: only load
	harddrake::bttv if the user click on "tv
	card" field in the hw summary window
	use harddrake::bttv to let people configure their tv card if it's
	misdetected

	* harddrake/ui.pm: remove uneeded "#!/...", standalone, lib, ... (this is
	a module)
	POSIX is no more used too.

	* harddrake/bttv.pm: remove device test: there're only two harddrake::bttv
	users,
	install_steps_interactive.pm and drakxtv which both have already
	tested that a bttv managed tv card is there.
	  - add more tv cards
	  - enable users to select number of buffers for mmap()
	  - better description for pll setting
	
	  - add tooltips help for some entries
	tv cards list:
	
		- split multi-cards entries
	
	     - reverse the hash (needed since now bttv card types are not
	       anymore unique)
	
		- complete the list from various sources
	
		- use a tree to display the list, it's clearer now since it's
	       splitted by vendors
	
	  - longer message
	  - remove uneeded stuff for modules ("#!/..", "use lib..", "use
	  standalone", ...)
	
	  - simplify bttv options managment:
	
	   - use if_, thanks MDK::Common
	
	   - s/mapn/map by using a hash at first
	
	   - s/mapn{if}/map{if_}
	
	  - don't read/write modules.conf here, drakx take care of that for us
	
	thus, the test program became:
	
	#!/usr/bin/perl
	
	use strict;
	use lib qw(/usr/lib/libDrakX);
	
	use standalone;
	use bttv;

	bttv::config('interactive'->vnew());

	* drakxtools.spec: fix typo
	fix dirs1/dirs2 mismatch
	  - M-q descriptions
	  - simplify file lists building
	  - we can use several -f on one "%%files" line

	* standalone/drakxtv: if we're root and there's a tv card managed by bttv,
	offer to
	configure bttv trough harddrake::bttv

	* tools/cvslog2changelog.pl: typo fix

	* harddrake/data.pm: remove uneeded "#!/.." and "use lib"

	* fs.pm (merge_info_from_fstab): try to keep options from merged fstab IF
	the entry is for the same mountpoint AND the same device
	handle comments in fstab

	* share/rpmsrate: add gnupg in "4 SYSTEM", so that rpm do not *Require*
	gnupg, only suggest it very strongly :)

	* mdk-stage1/usb-resource/update-usb-ids.pl: 
	  - do not use mar files for the list of modules, use list_modules.pm

	* printerdrake.pm: Fixed:
	  - Endless loop when entering printerdrake during installation in
	recommended
	mode without local printer
	  - Printerdrake was not closed when one was in the "Add Printer"
	sequence
	  during installation and one clicked another installation item (entries
	  on left hand side)
	  - When configuring printing only after installation Printerdrake tried
	to
	  check the installed queues without Foomatic being installed (bug was
	  already in 8.1, but noone discovered it).
	  - CUPS died when one tried to add a (local) printer in recommended
	mode
	  after installation.
	  - Improved text for the dialog telling that no local printer was
	detected.
	  - The list of auto-detected printers appeared as drop-down menu and
	not as
	  a list.

	* detect_devices.pm: In the USB auto-detection checked whether and where
	the device node was
	created.
	Fixes on device auto-detection:
	  - Made USB printer auto-detection routine in "detect_devices.pm"
	creating
	the appropriate device nodes (needed for USB printers being recognized
	  during installation).
	  - Fixed "devices.pm" to be able to handle device files with numbers
	geater
	  than 9 (ex: /dev/usb/lp10).

	* standalone/printerdrake: 
	  - Assure that Foomatic is installed before checking existing printer
	queues.

	* devices.pm: Fixes on device auto-detection:
	  - Made USB printer auto-detection routine in "detect_devices.pm"
	creating
	the appropriate device nodes (needed for USB printers being recognized
	  during installation).
	  - Fixed "devices.pm" to be able to handle device files with numbers
	geater
	  than 9 (ex: /dev/usb/lp10).

	* printer.pm: Added forgotten '$prefix'es.

	mode without local printer
	  - Printerdrake was not closed when one was in the "Add Printer"
	sequence

	* share/po/Makefile: fix yet again DrakX.pot making

	* partition_table.pm: re-add reiserfs as it should
	add xfs

2001/05/15  François Pons  <fpons@mandrakesoft.com>

	* rescue/tree/etc/oem: added missing Aurora, added icewm-light that may be
	usefull.

2001/05/15  Guillaume Cottenceau  <gc@mandrakesoft.com>

	* mdk-stage1/Makefile: libresolv deprecated in GLIBC
	have stage1-full with pcmcia also compile with dietlibc, cool!

	* mdk-stage1/network.c: fix guess netmask
	configure_net_device is only used internally

	* mdk-stage1/modules.c, mdk-stage1/modules.h: better modules handling
	interface (use of enum rather than guessing single numbers..)

	* mdk-stage1/newt-frontend.c: allow wait_message calls to be multi-lines

	* mdk-stage1/pcmcia/cardmgr.c: have stage1-full with pcmcia also compile
	with dietlibc, cool!
	  - build glibc and dietlibc targets
	  - bzero string buffer before sscanf call (dietlibc implementation)
	  - verify returns of ioperm so that I can use it in test mode

	* mdk-stage1/dietlibc/include/sys/file.h,
	mdk-stage1/dietlibc/include/sys/io.h,
	mdk-stage1/dietlibc/syscalls.s/ioperm.S: have stage1-full with pcmcia
	also compile with dietlibc, cool!

	* mdk-stage1/stage1.c: a bit of size reduction plus some language change
	blurk

	* mdk-stage1/WHY-DIETLIBC: advocate dietlibc

	* mdk-stage1/dietlibc/lib/vsscanf.c: import vsscanf fix from author

	* mdk-stage1/disk.c: bzero string buffer before sscanf call, security for
	dietlibc implementation

	* mdk-stage1/network.h: configure_net_device is only used internally

	* mdk-stage1/pcmcia/Makefile, mdk-stage1/pcmcia/pcmcia_probe.c: 
	  - build glibc and dietlibc targets
	  - bzero string buffer before sscanf call (dietlibc implementation)
	  - verify returns of ioperm so that I can use it in test mode

	* standalone/drakgw: full path for iptables

	* mdk-stage1/probing.c: allow wait_message calls to be multi-lines
	nicer layout for PCI detection messages
	better modules handling interface (use of enum rather than guessing
	single numbers..)

2001/05/15  Pablo Saratxaga <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* share/po/tr.po, share/po/ar.po: Updated Turkish file

	* share/keyboards.tar.bz2: Added north-african keyboard

	* keyboard.pm: added arabic azerty keyboard

2001/05/15  Pixel  <pixel@mandrakesoft.com>

	* share/po/Makefile: fix messages to i18n extracting

2001/05/14  Chmouel Boudjnah  <chmouel@mandrakesoft.com>

	* fs.pm: s|mkxfs|mkfs.xfs|;

2001/05/14  Guillaume Cottenceau  <gc@mandrakesoft.com>

	* mdk-stage1/nfsmount.c: use new gethostby* interface

	* mdk-stage1/stage1-data/stage1-with-busybox.tar.bz2: add stage1-data
	which provides the busybox

	* mdk-stage1/network.c: Have the wait_message() with the sleep()
	  - complies to gethostby functions
	  - add sleep(2) so that net intf is really up before operation
	  - more logs
	  - FTP: don't try to close control connection with data socket, erhm
	:-(
	  - debug netmask guessing, with stdio-frontend

	* mdk-stage1/Makefile: i can compile slang and newt with dietlibc now
	every targets build with dietlibc

	* mdk-stage1/make_boot_img: use busybox for my debugging purpose

	* mdk-stage1/tools.c: no need to poll() for data at beginning of
	load_ramdisk_fd, it was a fix of another problem (bug with file stdio
	operations with sockets in dietlibc)

	* mdk-stage1/dietlibc/Makefile: build this new dietlibc
	import new version of dietlibc

	* mdk-stage1/dns.c, mdk-stage1/dns.h: now use gethostby* functions
	provided by dietlibc

	* mdk-stage1/url.c: use poll() rather than select(), smaller code size

	* mdk-stage1/stage1.c: we don't use this sucking sash no more
	we now use `busybox' compiled with the marvellous dietlibc, which
	provides no less than 73 usefull binaries

	  - remember entries so that when there is a problem you don't have to
	re-enter everything (ncurses sucking stuff in case of stdio-frontend..)
	  - use larger buffer for list_directory since in /dev there can be
	*many* files
