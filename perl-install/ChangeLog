	* heavy modification of build_archive and extract_archive to manage
	a TOC directly in archive file, handle bzip2 or gzip compression,
	extract_archive can extract multiple files a time, with minimal
	invocation of uncompress program and follow symlink and expand
	directory contents.
	* use build_archive/extract_archive for locales.
	* fixed a min/max in install_steps_gtk for Resize/Create partition.
	* fixed adjustEnd with dos partition table, take care of magic 63
	sectors at beginning of partitions, a more solid method should be
	used for that.

	* partition_table.pm (add): cdie if maximum number of partitions
	handled by linux is reached

	* Xconfigurator.pm (chooseResolutionsGtk): display the graphic
	card or server found

	* install_any.pm (relGetFile): for mdkinst files, take care not to
	have a double '/' (see debbugs #591)

	* install_steps_interactive.pm (configureNetwork):
	purpose: add ability to configure both modem and lan
	         clean up the behaviour

	* fs.pm (write_fstab): 
	purpose: sort the fstab per mount point (cuz /usr must be before /usr/local)
	also: rewrite of the part writing the fstab.
