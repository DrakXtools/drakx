"drakTermServ Overview\n"
"\t\t\t   \n"
"        - Create Etherboot Enabled Boot Images:\n"
"        \t\tTo boot a kernel via etherboot, a special kernel/initrdrd image "
"must be created.\n"
"        \t\tmkinitrd-net does much of this work and drakTermServ is just a "
"graphical interface\n"
"        \t\tto help manage/customize these images.\n"
"\n"
"        - Maintain /etc/dhcpd.conf:\n"
"        \t\tTo net boot clients, each client needs a dhcpd.conf entry, "
"assigning an IP address\n"
"        \t\tand net boot images to the machine. drakTermServ helps create/"
"remove these entries.\n"
"\t\t\t\n"
"        \t\t(PCI cards may omit the image - etherboot will request the "
"correct image. You should\n"
"        \t\talso consider that when etherboot looks for the images, it "
"expects names like\n"
"        \t\tboot-3c59x.nbi, rather than boot-3c59x.2.4.19-16mdk.nbi).\n"
"\t\t\t \n"
"        \t\tA typical dhcpd.conf stanza to support a diskless client looks "
"like:\n"
"        \t\t\n"
"\t\t\t\thost curly {\n"
"\t\t\t\t\thardware ethernet        00:20:af:2f:f7:9d;\n"
"\t\t\t\t\tfixed-address              192.168.192.3;\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t/*type                          fat;*/\n"
"\t\t\t\t\tfilename                      \"i386/boot/boot-3c509.2.4.18-6mdk."
"nbi\";\n"
"\t\t\t\t}\n"
"\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\tWhile you can use a pool of IP addresses, rather than setup a specific "
"entry for\n"
"\t\t\ta client machine, using a fixed address scheme facilitates using the "
"functionality\n"
"\t\t\tof client-specific configuration files that ClusterNFS provides.\n"
"\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\tNote: The \"/*type\" entry is only used by drakTermServ.  Clients can "
"either be \"thin\"*/\n"
"\t\t\tor 'fat'.  Thin clients run most software on the server via xdmcp, "
"while fat clients run most\n"
"\t\t\tsoftware on the client machine. A special inittab, /etc/inittab\\$\\"
"$IP=client_ip\\$\\$ is\n"
"\t\t\twritten for thin clients. System config files xdm-config, kdmrc, and "
"gdm.conf are modified\n"
"\t\t\tif thin clients are used, to enable xdmcp. Since there are security "
"issues in using xdmcp,\n"
"\t\t\thosts.deny and hosts.allow are modified to limit access to the local "
"subnet.\n"
"\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\tNote: You must stop/start the server after adding or changing "
"clients.\n"
"\t\t\t\n"
"        - Maintain /etc/exports:\n"
"        \t\tClusternfs allows export of the root filesystem to diskless "
"clients. drakTermServ\n"
"        \t\tsets up the correct entry to allow anonymous access to the root "
"filesystem from\n"
"        \t\tdiskless clients.\n"
"\n"
"        \t\tA typical exports entry for clusternfs is:\n"
"        \t\t\n"
"        \t\t/                  (ro,all_squash)\n"
"        \t\t/home              SUBNET/MASK(rw,root_squash)\n"
"\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\tWith SUBNET/MASK being defined for your network.\n"
"        \t\t\n"
"        - Maintain /etc/shadow\\$\\$CLIENT\\$\\$:\n"
"        \t\tFor users to be able to log into the system from a diskless "
"client, their entry in\n"
"        \t\t/etc/shadow needs to be duplicated in /etc/shadow\\$\\$CLIENTS\\$"
"\\$. drakTermServ helps\n"
"        \t\tin this respect by adding or removing system users from this "
"file.\n"
"\n"
"        - Per client /etc/X11XF86Config-4\\$\\$IP-ADDRESS\\$\\$:\n"
"        \t\tThrough clusternfs, each diskless client can have it's own "
"unique configuration files\n"
"        \t\ton the root filesystem of the server. In the future drakTermServ "
"will help create these\n"
"        \t\tfiles.\n"
"\n"
"        - Per client system configuration files:\n"
"        \t\tThrough clusternfs, each diskless client can have it's own "
"unique configuration files\n"
"        \t\ton the root filesystem of the server. In the future, "
"drakTermServ can help create files\n"
"        \t\tsuch as /etc/modules.conf, /etc/sysconfig/mouse, /etc/sysconfig/"
"keyboard on a per-client\n"
"        \t\tbasis.\n"
"\n"
"        - /etc/xinetd.d/tftp:\n"
"        \t\tdrakTermServ will configure this file to work in conjunction "
"with the images created by\n"
"        \t\tmkinitrd-net, and the entries in /etc/dhcpd.conf, to serve up "
"the boot image to each\n"
"        \t\tdiskless client.\n"
"\n"
"        \t\tA typical tftp configuration file looks like:\n"

"        \t\t(\n"
"                        disable         = no\n"
"                        socket_type  = dgram\n"
"                        protocol        = udp\n"
"                        wait             = yes\n"
"                        user             = root\n"

"                        server_args  = -s /var/lib/tftpboot\n"
"        \t\t}\n"
"        \t\t\n"
"        \t\tThe changes here from the default installation are changing the "
"disable flag to\n"
"        \t\t'no' and changing the directory path to /var/lib/tftpboot, where "
"mkinitrd-net\n"
"        \t\tputs it's images.\n"
"\n"
"        - Create etherboot floppies/CDs:\n"
"        \t\tThe diskless client machines need either ROM images on the NIC, "
"or a boot floppy\n"
"        \t\tor CD to initate the boot sequence.  drakTermServ will help "
"generate these images,\n"
"        \t\tbased on the NIC in the client machine.\n"
