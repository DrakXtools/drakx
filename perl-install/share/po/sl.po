"At this point, you need to choose where you want to install the Mandrake\n"
"Linux operating system on your hard drive. If your hard drive is empty or\n"
"if an existing operating system is using all the available space, you will\n"
"need to partition it. Basically, partitioning a hard drive consists of\n"
"logically dividing it to create space to install your new Mandrake Linux\n"
"system.\n"
"\n"
"Because the partitioning process' effects are usually irreversible,\n"
"partitioning can be intimidating and stressful if you are an inexperienced\n"

"\n"
"If partitions have already been defined, either from a previous\n"
"installation or from another partitioning tool, simply select those to\n"

"\n"
"If partitions are not defined, you will need to create them using the\n"

"\n"
" * \"Use free space\": this option will simply lead to an automatic\n"
"partitioning of your blank drive(s). You will not be prompted further;\n"
"\n"
" * \"Use existing partition\": the wizard has detected one or more existing\n"
"Linux partitions on your hard drive. If you want to use them, choose this\n"
"option;\n"
"\n"
" * \"Use the free space on the Windows; partition\": if Microsoft Windows\n"
"is installed on your hard drive and takes all the space available on it,\n"
"you have to create free space for Linux data. To do so, you can delete your\n"
"Microsoft Windows partition and data (see ``Erase entire disk'' or ``Expert\n"
"mode'' solutions) or resize your Microsoft Windows partition. Resizing can\n"
"be performed without the loss of any data, provided you previously\n"

"This solution is recommended if you want to use both Mandrake Linux and\n"

"\n"
"   Before choosing this option, please understand that after this\n"
"procedure, the size of your Microsoft Windows partition will be smaller\n"
"than at the present time. You will have less free space under Microsoft\n"
"Windows to store your data or to install new software;\n"
"\n"
" * \"Erase entire disk\": if you want to delete all data and all partitions\n"
"present on your hard drive and replace them with your new Mandrake Linux\n"
"system, choose this option. Be careful with this solution because you will\n"
"not be able to revert your choice after you confirm;\n"
"\n"
"   !! If you choose this option, all data on your disk will be lost. !!\n"

"You can add additional entries for yaboot, either for other operating\n"

"\n"
"For other OSs, the entry consists only of a label and the \"root\"\n"

"\n"
"For Linux, there are a few possible options:\n"
"\n"
" * Label: this is simply the name you will have to type at the yaboot\n"
"prompt to select this boot option;\n"
"\n"
" * Image: this would be the name of the kernel to boot. Typically, vmlinux\n"
"or a variation of vmlinux with an extension;\n"
"\n"
" * Root: the \"root\" device or ``/'' for your Linux installation;\n"
"\n"
" * Append: on Apple hardware, the kernel append option is used quite often\n"
"to assist in initializing video hardware, or to enable keyboard mouse\n"
"button emulation for the often lacking 2nd and 3rd mouse buttons on a stock\n"

"hda=autotune\n"
"\n"
"         video=atyfb:vmode:12,cmode:24 adb_buttons=103,111\n"
"\n"
" * Initrd: this option can be used either to load initial modules, before\n"
"the boot device is available, or to load a ramdisk image for an emergency\n"
"boot situation;\n"
"\n"
" * Initrd-size: the default ramdisk size is generally 4,096 bytes. If you\n"
"need to allocate a large ramdisk, this option can be used;\n"
"\n"
" * Read-write: normally the \"root\" partition is initially brought up in\n"
"read-only, to allow a file system check before the system becomes ``live''.\n"
"Here, you can override this option;\n"
"\n"
" * NoVideo: should the Apple video hardware prove to be exceptionally\n"
"problematic, you can select this option to boot in ``novideo'' mode, with\n"
"native frame buffer support;\n"
"\n"
" * Default: selects this entry as being the default Linux selection,\n"

" * Kernel Boot Timeout: this timeout is similar to the LILO boot delay.\n"
"After selecting Linux, you will have this delay in 0.1 second before your\n"
