  bestKernelPackage so we must ensure the choice callback selects the good
  kernel (reported by Thomas Spuhler on cooker mailing list)
- do propose "Suisse" after selecting french language (#34675)
- use time() to know when to timeout (when launching installer X server)
  since the loop may be slower than 1 second (xf86misc::main::Xtest takes time
  on a failing X server on i810). Also print a message telling user to wait
  after 8 seconds.
