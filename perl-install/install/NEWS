- install linuxwacom if needed

  present (#8086)

  (will workaround #32547) (need perl-URPM 3.01)
- adapt to perl-URPM 3.00 API to parse pubkey files
- adjust Uzbek locale (cf locales-uz change)
- sort languages in "choose language" step in text mode
- diskdrake:

  keymaps, not installer simplified (?) .bkmap (#35376)

- partitioning wizard: ensure existing_part and resize_fat are proposed before
  wipe_drive
- in case of ftp/http media, we select basesystem before doing
  bestKernelPackage so we must ensure the choice callback selects the good
  kernel (reported by Thomas Spuhler on cooker mailing list)
- do propose "Suisse" after selecting french language (#34675)
- use time() to know when to timeout (when launching installer X server)
  since the loop may be slower than 1 second (xf86misc::main::Xtest takes time
  on a failing X server on i810). Also print a message telling user to wait
  after 8 seconds.
