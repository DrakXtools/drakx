"You now need to decide where you want to install the Mandriva Linux\n"

"partition the drive. Basically, partitioning a hard drive means to\n"
"logically divide it to create the space needed to install your new\n"
"Mandriva Linux system.\n"
"\n"
"Because the process of partitioning a hard drive is usually irreversible\n"
"and can lead to data losses, partitioning can be intimidating and stressful\n"
"for the inexperienced user. Fortunately, DrakX includes a wizard which\n"
"simplifies this process. Before continuing with this step, read through the\n"
"rest of this section and above all, take your time.\n"
"\n"
"Depending on the configuration of your hard drive, several options are\n"
"available:\n"
"\n"
" * \"%s\". This option will perform an automatic partitioning of your blank\n"
"drive(s). If you use this option there will be no further prompts.\n"
"\n"
" * \"%s\". The wizard has detected one or more existing Linux partitions on\n"
"your hard drive. If you want to use them, choose this option. You will then\n"
"be asked to choose the mount points associated with each of the partitions.\n"
"The legacy mount points are selected by default, and for the most part it's\n"
"a good idea to keep them.\n"
"\n"
" * \"%s\". If Microsoft Windows is installed on your hard drive and takes\n"
"all the space available on it, you will have to create free space for\n"
"GNU/Linux. To do so, you can delete your Microsoft Windows partition and\n"
"data (see ``Erase entire disk'' solution) or resize your Microsoft Windows\n"
"FAT or NTFS partition. Resizing can be performed without the loss of any\n"
"data, provided you've previously defragmented the Windows partition.\n"
"Backing up your data is strongly recommended. Using this option is\n"
"recommended if you want to use both Mandriva Linux and Microsoft Windows on\n"
"the same computer.\n"
"\n"
"   Before choosing this option, please understand that after this\n"
"procedure, the size of your Microsoft Windows partition will be smaller\n"
"than when you started. You'll have less free space under Microsoft Windows\n"
"to store your data or to install new software.\n"
"\n"
" * \"%s\". If you want to delete all data and all partitions present on\n"
"your hard drive and replace them with your new Mandriva Linux system, "
"choose\n"
"this option. Be careful, because you will not be able to undo this "
"operation\n"
"after you confirm.\n"
"\n"
"   !! If you choose this option, all data on your disk will be deleted. !!\n"
"\n"
" * \"%s\". This option appears when the hard drive is entirely taken by\n"
"Microsoft Windows. Choosing this option will simply erase everything on the\n"
"drive and begin fresh, partitioning everything from scratch.\n"
"\n"
"   !! If you choose this option, all data on your disk will be lost. !!\n"
"\n"
