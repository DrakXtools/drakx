"Because the process of partitioning a hard drive is usually irreversible\n"
"and can lead to data losses, partitioning can be intimidating and stressful\n"
"for the inexperienced user. Fortunately, DrakX includes a wizard which\n"

"rest of this section and above all, take your time.\n"
"\n"
"Depending on the configuration of your hard drive, several options are\n"

"\n"
" * \"%s\". This option will perform an automatic partitioning of your blank\n"
"drive(s). If you use this option there will be no further prompts.\n"
"\n"
" * \"%s\". The wizard has detected one or more existing Linux partitions on\n"
"your hard drive. If you want to use them, choose this option. You will then\n"
"be asked to choose the mount points associated with each of the partitions.\n"
"The legacy mount points are selected by default, and for the most part it's\n"
"a good idea to keep them.\n"
"\n"
" * \"%s\". If Microsoft Windows is installed on your hard drive and takes\n"
"all the space available on it, you will have to create free space for\n"
"GNU/Linux. To do so, you can delete your Microsoft Windows partition and\n"
"data (see ``Erase entire disk'' solution) or resize your Microsoft Windows\n"
"FAT or NTFS partition. Resizing can be performed without the loss of any\n"
"data, provided you've previously defragmented the Windows partition.\n"
"Backing up your data is strongly recommended. Using this option is\n"

"to store your data or to install new software.\n"
"\n"
" * \"%s\". If you want to delete all data and all partitions present on\n"

"after you confirm.\n"
"\n"
"   !! If you choose this option, all data on your disk will be deleted. !!\n"
"\n"
" * \"%s\". This option appears when the hard drive is entirely taken by\n"
