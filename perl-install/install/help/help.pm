the default and change the user name. The next step is to enter a password.

    N("You now need to decide where you want to install the Mandriva Linux
operating system on your hard drive. If your hard drive is empty or if an
existing operating system is using all the available space you will have to
partition the drive. Basically, partitioning a hard drive means to
logically divide it to create the space needed to install your new
Mandriva Linux system.

Because the process of partitioning a hard drive is usually irreversible
and can lead to data losses, partitioning can be intimidating and stressful
for the inexperienced user. Fortunately, DrakX includes a wizard which
simplifies this process. Before continuing with this step, read through the
rest of this section and above all, take your time.

Depending on the configuration of your hard drive, several options are
available:

 * \"%s\". This option will perform an automatic partitioning of your blank
drive(s). If you use this option there will be no further prompts.

 * \"%s\". The wizard has detected one or more existing Linux partitions on
your hard drive. If you want to use them, choose this option. You will then
be asked to choose the mount points associated with each of the partitions.
The legacy mount points are selected by default, and for the most part it's
a good idea to keep them.

 * \"%s\". If Microsoft Windows is installed on your hard drive and takes
all the space available on it, you will have to create free space for
GNU/Linux. To do so, you can delete your Microsoft Windows partition and
data (see ``Erase entire disk'' solution) or resize your Microsoft Windows
FAT or NTFS partition. Resizing can be performed without the loss of any
data, provided you've previously defragmented the Windows partition.
Backing up your data is strongly recommended. Using this option is
recommended if you want to use both Mandriva Linux and Microsoft Windows on
the same computer.

   Before choosing this option, please understand that after this
procedure, the size of your Microsoft Windows partition will be smaller
than when you started. You'll have less free space under Microsoft Windows
to store your data or to install new software.

 * \"%s\". If you want to delete all data and all partitions present on
your hard drive and replace them with your new Mandriva Linux system, choose
this option. Be careful, because you will not be able to undo this operation
after you confirm.

   !! If you choose this option, all data on your disk will be deleted. !!

 * \"%s\". This option appears when the hard drive is entirely taken by
Microsoft Windows. Choosing this option will simply erase everything on the
drive and begin fresh, partitioning everything from scratch.

   !! If you choose this option, all data on your disk will be lost. !!

 * \"%s\". Choose this option if you want to manually partition your hard
drive. Be careful -- it is a powerful but dangerous choice and you can very
easily lose all your data. That's why this option is really only
recommended if you have done something like this before and have some
experience. For more instructions on how to use the DiskDrake utility,

loader installation is totally automated. DrakX will analyze the disk boot
sector and act according to what it finds there:

 * if a Windows boot sector is found, it will replace it with a GRUB/LILO
boot sector. This way you'll be able to load either GNU/Linux or any other
OS installed on your machine.

 * if a GRUB or LILO boot sector is found, it'll replace it with a new one.

If DrakX cannot determine where to place the boot sector, it'll ask you
where it should place it. Generally, the \"%s\" is the safest place.

know what you're doing.", N("First sector of drive (MBR)"), N("Skip"));

    N("Now, it's time to select a printing system for your computer. Other
operating systems may offer you one, but Mandriva Linux offers two. Each of
the printing systems is best suited to particular types of configuration.

 * \"%s\" -- which is an acronym for ``print, do not queue'', is the choice
if you have a direct connection to your printer, you want to be able to
panic out of printer jams, and you do not have networked printers. (\"%s\"
will handle only very simple network cases and is somewhat slow when used
within networks.) It's recommended that you use \"pdq\" if this is your
first experience with GNU/Linux.

 * \"%s\" stands for `` Common Unix Printing System'' and is an excellent
choice for printing to your local printer or to one halfway around the
planet. It's simple to configure and can act as a server or a client for
the ancient \"lpd\" printing system, so it's compatible with older
operating systems which may still need print services. While quite
powerful, the basic setup is almost as easy as \"pdq\". If you need to
emulate a \"lpd\" server, make sure you turn on the \"cups-lpd\" daemon.
\"%s\" includes graphical front-ends for printing or choosing printer
options and for managing the printer.

If you make a choice now, and later find that you do not like your printing
system you may change it by running PrinterDrake from the Mandriva Linux
Control Center and clicking on the \"%s\" button.", N("pdq"), N("pdq"), N("CUPS"), N("CUPS"), N("Expert"));

Because hardware detection is not foolproof, DrakX may fail in detecting
your hard drives. If so, you'll have to specify your hardware by hand.

If you had to manually specify your PCI SCSI adapter, DrakX will ask if you
want to configure options for it. You should allow DrakX to probe the
hardware for the card-specific options which are needed to initialize the
adapter. Most of the time, DrakX will get through this step without any
issues.

which parameters need to be passed to the hardware, you'll need to manually

configuration. Click on the corresponding \"%s\" button to make the change.

is not in the list shown, click on the \"%s\" button to get the complete
country list.

you have chosen. You can click on the \"%s\" button here if this is not
correct.

detected, click on \"%s\" to try to configure it manually.

the card if you feel the configuration is wrong.

\"%s\" to reconfigure your graphical interface.
