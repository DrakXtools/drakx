Warning

Please read carefully the terms below. If you disagree with any
portion, you are not allowed to install the next CD media. Press 'Refuse' 
to continue the installation without using these media.


Some components contained in the next CD media are not governed
by the GPL License or similar agreements. Each such component is then
governed by the terms and conditions of its own specific license. 
Please read carefully and comply with such specific licenses before 
you use or redistribute the said components. 
Such licenses will in general prevent the transfer,  duplication 
(except for backup purposes), redistribution, reverse engineering, 
de-assembly, de-compilation or modification of the component. 
Any breach of agreement will immediately terminate your rights under 
the specific license. Unless the specific license terms grant you such
rights, you usually cannot install the programs on more than one
system, or adapt it to be used on a network. In doubt, please contact 
directly the distributor or editor of the component. 
Transfer to third parties or copying of such components including the 
documentation is usually forbidden.
