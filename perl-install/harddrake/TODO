* Harddrake TODO:
** fixes
*** IDE, SCSI: bus => bus_id, bus="IDE/SCSI" => move into DrakX
*** SCSI: get vendor string
*** timeout on dialogs in service
*** mouse.pm: only probe serial if :
**** serial mouse previously detected
**** no non-serial mouse found

** wishes
*** move all drakx tools into just a small one-liner that uses real <tool>.pm
    so that harddrake and mcc reduces their memory usage pattern and
    be faster (the next fast step will be to use perl6/parrot)
*** non needed stuff to run X must be posponed after X11 startup
**** eg: scanner/audio/printer/floppy/cdrom/tape/tv/webcam/joystick/ ... 
**** different modes:
***** neuneu => automatic config in service (ie for mouse/video card/...)
***** expert => run config tools

*** mode neuneu/expert => automatic/tools

** voir dadou -> interface

** missing
*** check4modem
*** subsys ... for sysv boot
*** su support
*** config module => expert only
*** mode expert => oui/non (cf dadou)
*** add updfstab
*** make all drakx tools a simple one-liner that call right module so that
    harddrake2 and mcc can load these tools without more ram eater
*** module options configuration button
*** enable the user to force a module (isa, isapnp, ...)
*** detect pcimcia:
  	
    foreach (detect_devices::pcmcia_probe()) {
        printf "m: %-15s t: %-20s d: %-12s  d: %s\n",
              $_->{driver}, $_->{type}, $_->{device}, $_->{description}
    }


** ensure scannerdrake use is ok (=> yvounet)

* Postponed
** use fbgtk+2 when booting on fbcon for smoother GUI
*** pixel, convert perl-GTK to gtk+2 :-)

** for to send a message for unknown hardware to install@mandrakesoft.com
*** use drakbugreport ?

no please.
just one month ago you switch SBLive from Alsa to OSS ( cause drakX
set it as OSS and harddrake as Alsa ).
There were also a discussion concerning the fact that Alsa doesn't
support emu-tools and so all available options.
Last but not least, several peoples report pbs with Alsa ( is sound is
too high you have disturbances ). So someone is going to ask you for
OSS as it want to use some features os SBLive, etc ...

To my mind the best way for this ( but too late for 8.2 ) will be to
have a tool called soundrake. Thanks to this tools, you choose at the
beginning if you want to use OSS or alsa and then try to correctly
configure your sound card. This tool should be able to work in
embended mo in harddrake or harddrake2 ( infos concerning this so long
awaiting harddrake 2 ? ).

In order to make this tool be a perfect tool, it should be able to
advice user concerning the advantage and the disadvantage of each
driver ( indeed alsa sometimes is better than OSS as it support full
duplex and wave mixing on more sound cards ).
It's also disturbing is harddrake set alsa by default and XrakX set
OSS by default as sometimes by lanching harddrake ( just to see what
happen ) you lose ( or seems to lose ) your sound card ( mute mixer )

For example :
+ launch harddrake
+ use autodetection : yes/no
+ if auto detects enable, it detects a SBLive.
+ explanations text concerning the fact that :
   if I use OSS I will be able to use sounds effects, live drive and
others things ( AC-3 passthrough ) thanks to the emu10k1-tools packages
( available on CD sets and installable via Software Manager )
   if I use Alsa, I won't be able to use emu10k1-tools but at the
contrary I will be able to use midi software as alsa module support midi
+ ask user which one he wants to use : OSS / Alsa ?
+ set the sound card drivers and modules.conf according to user wishes
+ <mode= dream> if I select OSS, installed emu10k1-tools and provide a
GUI to configure them </mode = dream>
+ <mode= dream> if I select Alsa unmute at least PCM and Vol or display
a warning saying that by default Alsa mute everything ( configure alsa
service so that it save mixer settings )
+ test the sound ( mandrake sound theme )
+ do you hear something ?
+ yes -> your sound card have been properly set.
+ if no -> try the others drivers set or send lspcidrake -v to
somebody@somewhere.org to check for support for your sound card
+ Do you ahave another sound card ?
