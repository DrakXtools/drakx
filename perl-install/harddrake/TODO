*** new cd burner: offer to install cdrecord and one of its gui frontends
*** new dvd driver : offer to install xine||mplayer
*** draksound :
**** add a dialog so that the user choose its wavetable.
**** list all availables drivers, defaulting to first alternative, prepending old one with '*'
**** add 'ALSA/OSS': tag to modules list
** detect engine:
*** detect isapnp devices
*** set more field for fscking 0x0000:0x0000 usb controllers

** move all drakx tools into just a small one-liner that uses real <tool>.pm
    so that harddrake and mcc reduces their memory usage pattern and
    be faster (the next fast step will be to use perl6/parrot)

    drawback : this would level down quite a lot the global mcc/harddrake robustness

no please.
just one month ago you switch SBLive from Alsa to OSS ( cause drakX
set it as OSS and harddrake as Alsa ).
There were also a discussion concerning the fact that Alsa doesn't
support emu-tools and so all available options.
Last but not least, several peoples report pbs with Alsa ( is sound is
too high you have disturbances ). So someone is going to ask you for
OSS as it want to use some features os SBLive, etc ...

To my mind the best way for this ( but too late for 8.2 ) will be to
have a tool called soundrake. Thanks to this tools, you choose at the
beginning if you want to use OSS or alsa and then try to correctly
configure your sound card. This tool should be able to work in
embended mo in harddrake or harddrake2 ( infos concerning this so long
awaiting harddrake 2 ? ).

In order to make this tool be a perfect tool, it should be able to
advice user concerning the advantage and the disadvantage of each
driver ( indeed alsa sometimes is better than OSS as it support full
duplex and wave mixing on more sound cards ).
It's also disturbing is harddrake set alsa by default and XrakX set
OSS by default as sometimes by lanching harddrake ( just to see what
happen ) you lose ( or seems to lose ) your sound card ( mute mixer )

For example :
+ launch harddrake
+ use autodetection : yes/no
+ if auto detects enable, it detects a SBLive.
+ explanations text concerning the fact that :
   if I use OSS I will be able to use sounds effects, live drive and
others things ( AC-3 passthrough ) thanks to the emu10k1-tools packages
( available on CD sets and installable via Software Manager )
   if I use Alsa, I won't be able to use emu10k1-tools but at the
contrary I will be able to use midi software as alsa module support midi
+ ask user which one he wants to use : OSS / Alsa ?
+ set the sound card drivers and modules.conf according to user wishes
+ <mode= dream> if I select OSS, installed emu10k1-tools and provide a
GUI to configure them </mode = dream>
+ <mode= dream> if I select Alsa unmute at least PCM and Vol or display
a warning saying that by default Alsa mute everything ( configure alsa
service so that it save mixer settings )
+ test the sound ( mandrake sound theme )
+ do you hear something ?
+ yes -> your sound card have been properly set.
+ if no -> try the others drivers set or send lspcidrake -v to
somebody@somewhere.org to check for support for your sound card
+ Do you ahave another sound card ?
