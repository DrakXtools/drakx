        drakxtools todo list for mdk9.2
        (mainly gtk+ oriented for now)

* mcc vs tools communication
** faster tools embedding in mcc (gc idea)
   move gui into gui/<sg>.pm so that mcc can just do require on them
   instead of doing slow fork+perl startup (same idea as fast_cgi,
   perl_mod and the like)
** told apps to ask user whether to save their changes or to discard them on cancel (#1437)

* ugtk2 & tools guies:
** cleanups:
*** $o->flush() should be sub { $_[0]->window->process_updates(1) }
    see logdrake::parse_file()'s progress bar as an example
** saner/cleaner usage of gtk+-2.2 widgets:
*** use MessageDialog for modal windows (cleaner)
*** use button boxes everywhen when we have several buttons for saner gui (as per gnome specs/recommendations)
*** gtk::combo => gtk::optionMenu (as per gtk+-2 doc)
*** use size::group to let things be smoother in some places

* tools
** all:
*** have a button or a menu to access help (was already part of mdk9.1 specs)
** drakboot:
*** should prevent the user to insert a space in a kernel label (#2826)
** mcc:
*** make tool names be black or blue (like in rpmdrake & harddrake2 guies) (#2695)
** harddrake: colorize the internal help


* packages
** main package updates:
*** rpm-4.2
*** kernel-2.6 (if availlable and stabilized: not probable) ?
** add new packages:
*** kernel-mosix
*** dvb packages

* hardware support
** kernel: update alsa, bttv, dvb & saa7134 drivers for better hardware support
** isa detection/probing in ldetect ? (#118, #497) => need some old hw
