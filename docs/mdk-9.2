        drakxtools todo list for mdk9.2
        (mainly gtk+ oriented for now)

* mcc vs tools communication
** faster tools embedding in mcc (gc idea)
   move gui into gui/<sg>.pm so that mcc can just do require on them
   instead of doing slow fork+perl startup (same idea as fast_cgi,
   perl_mod and the like)
** told apps to ask user whether to save their changes or to discard them on cancel (#1437)
** to let diskdrake fit better when embedded, we should write "formated - mounted" rather than "formated\nmounted"

* ugtk2 & tools guies:
** cleanups:
*** $o->flush() should be sub { $_[0]->window->process_updates(1) }
    see logdrake::parse_file()'s progress bar as an example
** saner/cleaner usage of gtk+-2.2 widgets:
*** use MessageDialog for modal windows (cleaner)
*** use button boxes everywhen when we have several buttons for saner gui (as per gnome specs/recommendations)
*** gtk::combo => gtk::optionMenu (as per gtk+-2 doc)
*** use size::group to let things be smoother in some places

* tools
** all:
*** have a button or a menu to access help (was already part of mdk9.1 specs)
*** rename and provide compatibility links:
**** adduserdrake  => drakeuseradd
**** diskdrake     => drakdisk
**** harddrake     => drakhw
**** keyboarddrake => drakkeyboard
**** localedrake   => draklocale
**** logdrake      => draklog
**** menudrake     => drakmenu [fredc]
**** mousedrake    => drakmouse
**** printerdrake  => drakprinter
**** userdrake     => drakuser [deush]
**** XFdrake       => drakx11
** drakboot:
*** should prevent the user to insert a space in a kernel label (#2826)
*** fix "Display theme under console" setting from current theme config file (#2662)
** mcc:
*** make tool names be black or blue (like in rpmdrake & harddrake2 guies) (#2695)
*** hide non executable programs instead of warning at runtime if program isn't executable
*** make more program being options rather than depandancies (ie like rpmdrake and drakwizard)
*** add scrollbars if root window is below 800x600 (#2961)
*** add scrollbars for too big translated messages (but how to detect it)
*** move drakedm from hardware to system section
** harddrake: colorize the internal help
** rpmdrake
*** save mode (sort by group, mdk choice, ...)


* packages
** main package updates:
*** rpm-4.2
*** kernel-2.6 (if availlable and stabilized: not probable) ?
    at least, keep kernel-2.4.x
** add new packages:
*** kernel-mosix
*** dvb packages: vcr, vdr, ...
** icewm/windowmaker/other wm
*** export BROWSER like gnome/kde (look at /etc/gnome/gnomerc)

* hardware support
** kernel: update alsa, bttv, dvb & saa7134 drivers for better hardware support
   add "REGISTER ^dvb/adapter[0-9]+/[^/]+$ PERMISSIONS root.video 0660" to devfsd
** add cx88 driver from http://bytesex.org/snapshot
** isa detection/probing in ldetect ? (#118, #497) => need some old hw in order to test
   probably not
