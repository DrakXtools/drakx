# This file contains all the bugs/glitches/inconsistencies shipped in
# 9.0 (Dolphin) Mandrake Linux Release.

# Feel free to add your entry and if possible the fixes and status of
  the errata.

 o Drakxtools:
   ==========  

   widget libraries:

    In both XFdrake and printerdrake pop up small, empty, gray windows when 
    clicking in the main menu. STATUS: Not fixed.

    Scroll bars and widget sizes often not correct (visible primarily in the
    printer options step of the "Add printer" wizard of printerdrake. STATUS:
    Not fixed.
   
   harddrake:

   logdrake:
    IS: Send the alert mail when service is stopped but the mail
	      is empty.
    SHOULD BE: incorporate a text on which service is stopped.
    Status: not fixed. 

 o Drakconf:
   =========
   IS: locale nl_NL, sl and zh_CN prevent drakconf from starting with
   a "cannot call set_active on undefined values" error.

   SHOULD BE: work well in all locales.
   
   a workaround has been comitted

 o Drakfont:
   =========

   drakfont get stopped in stat64("/mnt/nt/winnt/fonts/8514oem.fon",
   ...) on ntfs partitions.
   there's a bug in ntfs.o fs module of the kernel

 o Install: 
   ========
 
 o urpmi
   =====

   "urpmi mplayer" shows a list of libraries it needs and asks whether
   to install all this, after saying "y", it says that all these
   packages are missing and fails (I have shown it to François and he
   says that is a bug with the "contribs". He had to regenerate the
   hdlists somehow. STATUS: Not fixed.

 o XFree 4.2.x
   ===========

   Touchpad mouse on my Asus S8600 notebook. Worked out-of-the-box
   with Mandrake 8.2, but in 9.0 I cannot do any dragging operation
   with the PS/2-"Standard" mouse setting. I switched to "Glidepoint"
   with mousedrake and then dragging works, but the emulation of the
   third button by pressing both buttons not. Adding the lines

      Option "Emulate3Buttons"
      Option "Emulate3Timeout" "50"

   to the mouse section of /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 manually fixes the
   middle-button problem. STATUS: Not fixed.



   Sometimes, XFree86 can cause sound glitches because of intensive
   pci bus usage.
   Adding the line

      Option "PciRetry" "true"

   to the "Device" section /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 fixes these boxes.


 o Printer drivers
   ===============

   "Best Grayscale" mode of HP DeskJet 6xx and Apollo printers does
   not work. STATUS: Fixed on linuxprinting.org, needs to be packaged
   in "printer-drivers".

o kernel:
  =======

  Sometimes reboot stops on "illegal seek" message (having /usr on /
  fs fix it)

  Sometimes process get blocked in D-state on ntfs partitions (see
  drakfont)

  i810_audio mistakely say to modules.pm through modules.*map it
  handles nforces whereas it lacks some workaround nvidia and alsa
  uses.
  workaround: perl-install/patch/patch-nforce.pl

  snd-via686 is said to produce background noise since alsa-0.9.0rc3
  workaround: switch to via82cxxx_audio (oss driver) through draksound
