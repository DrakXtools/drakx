How to handle wizard?

to switch in wizard mode:
set $::isWizard to true;
if $::Wizard_no_previous is set to true, the wizard won't display the previous button. Usefull for first step
if $::Wizard_finished is set to true, the wizard will display Finish instead of Next. Usefull for last step

how to code:
Code as if there were no wizard.
OK button is displayed as Next
Cancel is displayed as Previous
a additional button Cancel is added, xhich die with the exception 'wizard_cancelled'

You have to handle the previous button. For example:

step 1:
ask_from list( blablablabl) or return;
step2:
ask_from list( blablablabl) or goto step1;
step3:
ask_from list( blablablabl) or goto step2;

etc... You don't have to handle the wizard Cancel button as it send an exception.

Understood? If yes, you'll see that there is a pb with ask_yesorno. In this case, yes+next returns true, no+next returns false, Cancel send the exception 'wizard_canceled' and previous send the exception 'wizard previous'. So you have to handle the previous button manually.

plop.
