(fpons)pb with dependencies ``missing'': icewm do not require XFree86 and so you can have icewm but no X server

XFdrake chooseResolutions with ask_from_list do not permit ``Show all''

have a better time estimation of the remaining time in install packages

smaller zsh (or ash in initrd)

initrd in bzip2

aha152x needs "insmod aha152x.o aha152x=0x140,11,7"

# in 2.3.15 "Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS]|SiS900 10/100 Ethernet" is handled

(?)strange: no scsi of type 'fd', only 'tape'
