i18n

wizard for partitioning in case of one full vfat

diskdrake in text mode

ability to add nfs/weird_fs entries in fstab

language support: only choose the right locales and upmark the packages requiring it

standalone applications for configuration (netdrake)

is configureNetworkNet needed with dhcp/bootp?

(pix)kickstart
X configuration and bootloader in kickstart

(pix)Tree -> CTree, ``all'' branch with all packages

install ssh

(fpons)verify the free space is big enough.

(fpons)pb with dependencies ``missing'': icewm do not require XFree86 and so you can have icewm but no X server

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

XFdrake chooseResolutions with ask_from_list do not permit ``Show all''

have a better time estimation of the remaining time in install packages

smaller zsh (or ash in initrd)

initrd in bzip2

(pix)options in mkfs, progress bar when formatting

aha152x needs "insmod aha152x.o aha152x=0x140,11,7"

try detect_devices::floppies (and how are scsi floppies handled?)
maybe: do a iotcl FDGETPRM to detect fd1, fd0.

cancel button in packages installation

grub, chos

(?)maybe remove commented lines in /usr/lib/perl5/... files

(?)timezone using a picture (pb: how to delimit zones)
the list is too big for USA

(fpons)handle dat drives

sound config

(?)ability to select the type of install when booting of cdrom
(?)use the ability of el torito to handle 2.88MB or more 

add fdisk using the zvt widget (taken in gnome-libs)

using setxkb, enable the testing of the keyboard

enable the testing of the mouse type (under X) (wheel)

diskdrake should warn if nb_ide_parts > 63, nb_scsi_parts > 15

(?)loadFont sucks

(obsolete)trash on the screen when X first starts

(?)get the error when reading .rpm files fail

(?)remove the gray line surrounding the logo

# in 2.3.15 "Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS]|SiS900 10/100 Ethernet" is handled

(?)strange: no scsi of type 'fd', only 'tape'

XFree: handle by card options
eg: SIS6326 needs "no_bitblt" "no_bltimage" and 24bpp instead of 32bpp
