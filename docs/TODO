kickstart like
tolook qw(fstab )

warn the user if not enough ram to fulfill install

c::XSetInputFocus is done only on map_event. so pb with setuprootpassword (eg)

blank alt-f1 screen on exit

keyboard shortcuts for the setstep stuff

test after printer config

upgrade

diskdrake should warn if nb_ide_parts > 63, nb_scsi_parts > 15

propose fb in XFdrake

update the list of modules (in update_kernel)

look at the pcmcia case

merge the install(1) of redhat

lilo-deinstallation in case of lilo auto-installation for beginners

in package choosing, the group (on the left) is no more `selected' (gtk focus) when clicking on a package (on the right)

verify the free space is big enough.

loadFont sucks

have a better time estimation of the remaining time in install packages

trash on the screen when X first starts

get the error when reading .rpm files fail

ask for notepad (aka portable) or not
ask for hdparm or not
ask for more than the memory size detected
ask for the VGA mode for lilo or vidmode
ask the security level

lilo (ask the timeout, prompt or not)

add a log != tty3 (like /tmp/...)

remove the gray line surrounding the logo

pb with dependencies ``missing'': icewm do not require XFree86 and so you can have icewm but no X server

rewrite mouseconfig in perl?

cleanup /etc/services & /etc/protocols

maybe remove commented lines in /usr/lib/perl5/... files

handle zip/dat drives

remove cpio from base when mkbootdisk deps is added

quotema in _ask_from_list in my_gtk

look at SuperProbe

timezone using a picture (pb: how to delimit zones)

suggested partition tables must be better foreach installClass

the different xmodmaps for every languages (maybe gnome-core xmodmaps can help)
xmodmap needed even for english as the backspace is not what it should

aha152x needs "insmod aha152x.o aha152x=0x140,11,7"

have isofs in module.

replace in place catchable die's by cdie's  (as in partition_table::load)

strange: no scsi of type 'fd', only 'tape'

try detect_devices::floppies (and how are scsi floppies handled?)
maybe: do a iotcl FDGETPRM to detect fd1, fd0.

test smp (is it enough to scan /proc/cpuinfo for multiple /^processor/ lines?)

remove the nasty wrapping arrow (in help) by patching gtk :(

in ask_from_list, the horizontal scroll is buggy

df is bugged (show bad sizes)

wish: ability to select the type of install when booting of cdrom

use the ability of el torito to handle 2.88MB or more 

use ddcprobe monitor's size info for pnp monitors
use ddcprobe video card memory size info
use ddcprobe modelines to reduce the available resolutions
