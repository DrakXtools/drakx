+ Open Development (at least DrakX)
+ UDMA66 (HPT366)
+ gamerz
+ number of packages

+ More user-friendliness in general:
	+ you can choose between multiple net devices when more than one are
	detected
	+ you are presented with the media descriptions (disks, cdrom's)
	when you must choose between multiple media, and not only "sda",
	"hdc", ..
	+ when installing from a disk partition, you are presented with an
	extract of the directory contents when you fail to give the
	correct location, which is very helpful to correct the input
	instead of simply rebooting to remember where on earth you
	mirrored the distribution on your disks

+ Automatic mode (Redhat's equivalent is called "kickstart") is not
  performed according to a file on the floppy but from kernel parameters,
  which have many pros, among them: (1) we don't need the vfat filesystem
  for that purpose, and (2) with advanced bootloaders such as grub and
  lilo you can edit parameters on the fly at boot time.

- no LABEL= in fstab (for auto renumbering of devices)
- kerberos
- LDAP
