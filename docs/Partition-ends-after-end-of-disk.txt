        Cylinder/Head/Size Hell Is Not Over

Nowadays, you can boot Linux without every relying on CHS
(Cylinder/Head/Size):

- CHS information on partition table is obsolete and not used anymore.
It was causing the 1024th cylinder limitation:
  - disallowing partitions above 8GiG. Problem overcome using 32bits linear
  addressing in partition table.
  - disallowing to boot on partition above 8GiG (due to int13 limitation used
  in bootloaders). Problem overcome using int13 extensions (EDD)

Logical CHS (Cylinder/Head/Size) and physical CHS are not related anymore.
Especially the size of a hard drive is not a multiple of the number of
Cylinders.


The problem is that many tools still rely somewhat heavily on CHS information.
- most tools adjust partitions on cylinder boundary
- some tools compute the size of the disk based on CHS (eg: fdisk)


Resulting problems in various tools:

- last partition not cylinder boundary adjusted, and overrun CHS computed size
  - fdisk
    > Total allocated sectors %d greater than the maximum %d
  - cfdisk (need confirmation)
    > FATAL ERROR: Bad primary partition %d: Partition ends after end-of-disk
    or
    > FATAL ERROR: Bad logical partition %d: Partition ends after end-of-disk
  - Partition Magic (version?)
    (doesn't like it, what error message?)
  - Windows <= 98se, Windows Me
    (doesn't like it, what error message?)

  Tools handling it correctly:
  - parted and so diskdruid in RedHat >= 7.2 (or is it 7.x?)
  - diskdrake >= Mandrake 8.2
  - Windows XP (need confirmation)

  Tools using the full size of the disk, and so causing pbs with fdisk/cfdisk/...:
  - diskdrake >= Mandrake 8.2
  - parted (what about diskdruid??)

- disagreement between CHS and linear address
  - parted
