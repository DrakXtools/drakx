   =======

   - ntfs driver has a hang, additionally also causing 100% cpu usage
     if either the size of the ntfs filesystem or the number of MFT
     entries fell to a certain range and statfs() system call was
     invoked by an application (e.g. df, gnome system monitor, etc).
     see #3353

     it got fixed quickly but unfortunately too late for us

     the probability one hits this bug is 0.2% or every 512th users.

     updated ntfs driver (2.1.2a) is at the usual place,
