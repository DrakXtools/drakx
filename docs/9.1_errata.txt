 o Kernel:
   =======

   - ntfs driver has a hang, additionally also causing 100% cpu usage
     if either the size of the ntfs filesystem or the number of MFT
     entries fell to a certain range and statfs() system call was
     invoked by an application (e.g. df, gnome system monitor, etc).
     see #3353

     it got fixed quickly but unfortunately too late for us

     the probability one hits this bug is 0.2% or every 512th users.

     updated ntfs driver (2.1.2a) is at the usual place,

 o DrakxTools:
   ===========
   - drakconnect:
     o ltmodem support is missing from mdk9.1 [added in hp release]
     o various other fixes came into mdk4hp release

   - explanations: most common ones are not logged because of a
     standalone.pm vs common.pm methods overloading bug [not yet
     fixed]

   - harddrake-ui:
     o menu entry starts logdrake instead of harddrake's gui [fixed in
       cvs]
     o status bar is not cleared on config tool exit [fixed in cvs]
     o title bar miss some spaces in french locale [fixed in cvs]

   - harddrake service: 5 second timeout was too short so it was
     increased up to 25 seconds [in hp release]

   - localedrake/drakx: legal problem with rpc vs hong-kong||taiwan
     [fixed in hp release]
