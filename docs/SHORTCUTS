list choice

- acceleration a la windows (default): enter a letter and the selection will move to the
first entry beginning with that letter. If you enter another letter it will try
to find the entry beginning with the 2 letters you have given. In case it fails
the starting_word is reset.
- incremental search a la emacs: searches trough the list

Use control-s to use incremental search and then to search next occurence

in case of complete mouse sh**t

XFree86 provides a way of moving the mouse pointer:
- first, press Ctrl-Shift-NumLock
- then move the pointer with the keypad arrows
- press button is ``0'' (aka Inser)
- release button is ``.'' (aka Suppr)
