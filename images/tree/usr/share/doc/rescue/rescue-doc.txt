Are you certain "rescue mode" is the best tool for your specific
problem?

The rescue system on this CD is a very basic text-based
environment for rescuing systems that no longer boot. You will
not find an easy-to-use graphical environment in this rescue
system, nor the Moondrake detection/configuration libraries.


The vast majority of problems that can affect a Linux system are
much easier to repair on a running system than by booting into
"rescue mode". In fact, there are very few problems which aren't
easier to resolve in the comfortable environment of a fully
installed Moondrake GNU/Linux system than in this spartan "rescue
system" shell. Some of the most common problems include:

- bad or missing X (video display) configuration
- adding/removing/reconfiguring hardware
- repairing problems caused by installing third-party software
  with the "--force" and "--nodeps" options

The general rule of thumb is: "If you can boot into the Linux
system without using rescue mode or this CD, there is no real
reason to use the rescue CD".


However, if you can no longer boot into the system, the rescue
system is the right tool. Some common examples include:

- If you previously changed some parameters in the /etc/fstab and
  the system will no longer boot, fix the offending line while in
  rescue mode, then try to boot normally into your system.

- If the problem cannot be completely resolved in rescue mode
  (for example, if you need to reconfigure the video display),
  just modify what's necessary to boot into a running system,
  then complete the fix from there.

In case you have found a new problem which should be handled by
"rescue mode" but currently isn't, please report it to
