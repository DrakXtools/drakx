Version 1.4 - 8 March 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- restore vga= and automatic= default options.
  also restore noacpi, alt0, vgalo, vgahi, text entries
  (all this is needed when gfxboot is not working or not there)

Version 1.3 - 16 February 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- rely on gfxboot for options (vga=, automatic=...)
- really use memtest instead of memtest.bin
  (with file name "memtest.bin" it fails with error 8000, with "memtest" it works)
  (it seems to be an ancient bug as far as google says)
