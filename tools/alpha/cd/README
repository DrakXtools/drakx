!! beta version !!

Mandrake Alpha short Howto-Install :

* to install from the cdrom:

- either boot on the cdrom:
  - in SRM, find the device name corresponding to the cdrom (`show device' can help)
  - enter `boot dqa0 -fl 0' (replacing dqa0 by the cdrom device)

- or you can boot on a floppy:
  - first create a boot floppy from images/cdrom.img
  - in SRM, find the device name corresponding to the floppy (`show device' can help)
  - enter `boot dva0 -fl 0' (replacing dva0 by the floppy device)
  - fulfill the install.

* on reboot:

- either enter `boot XXXX -fl 0' where XXXX is the device where you installed
the system 

- if the device is not available via SRM, use the
cdrom: `boot dqa0 -file boot/v.gz -fl root=/dev/sda1' (replace sda1 by the
root you installed on, and dqa0 by the cdrom device)


* to install from the network:

Same as for the cdrom install, except give `boot dqa0 -fl 1' or boot on
images/network.img floppy (with `boot dva0 -fl 0')
