Mini-Howto on burning Mandrake PPC Bootable CD's for Apple G3/G4 systems
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To create a disk image simply use the mkINSTALLCD script provided in this
directory. The path you provide the script should point to the root directory
for the CD.

For example after you have built the gi install with /export, simply pass 
/export to the script as the distribution path and a name for the image.
Once the image is built you can use hmount, humount, hdir, hcd and hattrib
to modify and inspect the image before you commit it to CD-R.

Before you run the script make sure the CD version of iBoot is in the 
iBoot directory below /export (eg. /export/iBoot), if you want to use some 
other directory then simply modify the script. Beware, HFS is not case
sensitive, so if you already have an INSTALL file you cannot create install.

Currently iBoot sports two trees, one for the install CD and another for
regular usage. These will be merged shortly and a simply #define can be used
in the Makefile to implement one or the other from a single binary.

Enjoy!!

A couple of changes.  

I've opted to standardize on yaboot, which is user configurable, so the script 
is modified now to use yaboot.

Secondly, since mkhybrid merged with mkisofs, the hybrid images it creates are 
read-only, so one is unable to mount the image and bless the boot directory for
booting.  Consequently, I've included the binary for mkhybrid-1.12b5.4, which
does work.
