aewm-drakx - A DrakX-aware X11 Window Manager
======================================================================
aewm-drakx is a stripped down version of aewm with keyboard focus added.
The main and only purpose of aewm-drakx is to provide keyboard focus.

Thanks to aewm author for his job. The already small aewm, gives a tiny WM
(source < 4Kl, binary < 8KB) when stripped down of nearly everything.

Pixel.
